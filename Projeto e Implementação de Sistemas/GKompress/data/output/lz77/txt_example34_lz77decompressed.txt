Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock

Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man

We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top ofbooks
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name
Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'

But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave

How low can you go?(x8) (Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8) Hahaha Luda! (Luda) [Verse 1]
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top ofyo booty jigglin' out yo'jeans
Baby pull yo'pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
BUT, how low can you go
Lower than yo' mamas ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would of imagined it
Not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doin' it on the dance floor
Mad 'cuz I can't get with you
Just show me how to dance (OOOH)
I may not want to get low
So I'm post it up kinda like a playa do
But ifyou come to the crib then
I might show you girls a thang or 2
Yeah I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big there's just one thing that I gotta know [Chorus]
(Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8) (Shawnna)
I could go low, (go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know, (Luda) [Verse 2]
I be like knick knack paddy wack
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'till I get to the center
And let a reala nigga take you home
I can make this show stop
As soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to yo' drop
Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really gettin low,
Then I'mma shoot a video and put it all on T.V.
'Cuz I like that French vanilla and the caramel
BUT, when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them Puerto Rican pecan
Peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces
'Cuz I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big well there's just one thing that I gotta know [Chorus] (Luda) [Verse 3]
Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't stop (get it get it)
Put it in reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me what you working with
I'll show you some of this bank roll
Yeah you a superstar
There's just a thing I gotta know
So... [Chorus] Yeah, Welcome to Atlanta, jack and hammer and vogues'
Back to the mackin' and jackin' the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'
A knock on the do', who is it?
I would happen to know, the one with the flow
Who did it?, it was me I suppose
J-D in the Rollz and Luda's in the Cutt Supreme
Skatin down old Nat, Gat tooked and lean
I split ya spleen, as matter' fact I split ya team
No blood on the sneak's, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
Im allergic to 'doc perscribed anti-histemines
Oink Oink, Pig Pig, do away with the pork
Only siguar needs a steak knife and a fork

The Wooley mammoth saber-tooth, bitch bite your tounge

So I stripped them off the wall
Waiting for    cue to corner pocket eight balls

In fact Im slappin' 'em up, Cadallacin' the truck

Try ta make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name
Oh a sauna, ja'causezi
In the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off of her feet (chorus) I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up on alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around
Georgia brown
That's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, over worked, under paid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Baby your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team off the rope
On the ocean or in the boat
Factories, or a hunred spokes
What 'bout in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little bootie up with my belt
Scream help
Play my game
Dracula n I'll get my fangs
Horse back I'll get my reigns
School teacher let me get my grades (chorus) x4 Heads up! Heads up!
Here's another one!
And a, and another one

Cause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack
But I ain't speaking about balling, balling
Just thinking about brawling till y'all start bawling
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changing the weather now

Sent him on his way cause I ain't for that talk!
No trips to the county, I ain't for that walk!

We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your vain
Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo chain

Disturbin tha Peace Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia [Chorus: x2]
We on the grind in, Georgia
All the time,it ain't
Nothing on my mind but - Georgia
We ain't playing with you Country name , Country slang,
Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit
That's why I keep my Georgia tech in the state of - Georgia [Chorus: x2] I'm from the home of neckbones , blackeyed peas,
Turnip and collard greens we
The children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee,
G.A the peach state where we stay,
My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass:40:plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia [Chorus: x2] Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us:40me mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,
I got a Chevrolet on 26's,
I'm from G.A , G.A - Georgia [Chorus: x2] Georgia , Georgia , Georgia , Georgia - Georgia How low can you go? How low can you go?

A lot of women drop it to the ground,
But how low can you go?
Lower then your mama's ever seen it in her life time,
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind,
Practice in front of that mirror,
Now you doing it on the dance floor,
Mad cause I can't get wit chick ya just show me how to dance (Oh!)
I may not wanna get low:40:I post it up kinda like a playa do,
But if you come to the crib,

Till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home,
I could make me show stop,
Soon as you hear this flow pop,
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your block,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin' low then I'm a shoot a video and put it all on T-V,
Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel,
But when it comes to chocolate,

Asian persuasion,
No discrimination,

Runaway love Now little Lisa is only nine years old
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone, and they never met her family
Mama's always gone, and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listen
Mama on drugs, gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with s0me laughs, usually endin' in a fight
Sneak int0:her room while her mama's knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist, but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom, but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout t0:run away and never c0me back Runaway love

She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty, and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with s0me bruises
Teachers ask questions; she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is:lil' Stacy, and they bec0me friends
Promise that they'll always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own

She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops Ex to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep, and she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection; he's usin' no glove
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by, and her belly gets big
The father bails out; he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor, so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say she's about t0:run away and never c0me back Runaway love

She makes her own money, pays her own bills, always stat fly, keeps it so real,
But behind closed doors she a nasty girl behind closed doors she a nasty girl.
She got a crazy little figure, nice round ass, walks so proper, talks with such class,
But behind closed doors she a nasty girl, behind closed doors she a nasty girl. I met this girl named Keysha, she was so sweet
Nails stay manicured, pretty little feet
Shoes so sexy, body so hot
Hair lookin' like she just came from the shop
Legs so smooth, clothes so tight
Style so sexy, make her just right
Never too much, never too little
Black laced bra, Vicki secrets in the middle
Eyes so innocent, smile so bright
Works in the mornin, but she'll party all night
All for a man, all 'cause she bought it
All 'cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it
Product of her birth place, know about the streets
Clean in the work place, dirty in the sheets
Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed [Chorus] I got a college girl go to church every Sunday
Had to sneak her outta choir for her to put it on me
But she so innocent, when she when she around her mommy
One thing about her she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin' laundry
Favorite toy of mine is my lil bunny
Bow legged and glasses, such a real woman
Sex all night, go to work every mornin'
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her me too mommy
When y   get off work daddy gon' punish
You're my nasty girl forever I promise [Chorus] I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me come home soon
She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a docs supposed ta
All white coat, all white heels
And nothin' underneath so its an all night deal
I'm a number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her Vitamin D
But wait, I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
She said she needs some evidence and to show her the proof
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth
Cause I'm hung like a jury
Judge Luda preside over y    body and I'm never in a hurry
You may proceed, let the games begin
And if I call a miss trial we gotta do it again [Chorus] I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again
Let's party again

I blow some smoke to gilicmy lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
I'm on a jo  ney yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes just tocopen my soul
And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool
So if y   go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go fo  broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, for the rest of my life If I got one life to live, I'mma pa ty 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
Trying to keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say "Women, Weed, and Alcohol" That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go fo  broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey If y   live for somethin'
Y  're not alone my friend
So fill up y    cup and lift yo   lighter
A toast to life I'm stuck in this moment, freeze tlichands of time
'Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And y   can call me crazy, but I like to roll tlicdice
So I'm willing to bet tlat I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Chorus: (2x)

Filling in the Gump wit no track of Tom Hanks
Go put this in y    jaw like weeners and beef franks Chorus (2x) I put too much sugar in my Kool Aid
And pa ty like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I'd like to get paid
Arrive to a ho and I'd like to get laid
Right up on my back like rugs and floor mats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bosack
Did y   know that
Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stove so gilicme the keys to the Range
Shagadelic beautiful but strange

Cause I've been placis where y  'll never imagine, but I'ma start at home,
I walk straight up to tlim and I'm like (ugh), Hey girl how ya doing,
Y   are the woman that I'm really pursuin,
I would like to get to know ya, can y   gimme ya name,
If y   jot down ya number y  'll get mine in exchange, Hey!
See I'm the man of this town,
And I hope y   wouldn't mind if I showed y   around,
So when y   go to certain placis y  'll be thinking of me,
We got people to meet and many placis to see, Hey!
I'm really digging ya lips,
But be careful where y   walking when y   swinging tlim hips,
I'm kinda concerned that y  'll be causing a crash
Wit ya traffic jam booty, heads pausing so fast, Hey!
I wouldn't trade y   for the world I swear it,
I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it,
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes,
From yo   manicur/unnails to ya pedicur/untoes [Chorus] [Ludacris]

Don't always think I'm trying to get in y    pants,

Trying to show ya that living is trife,
How many guys y   know that can bring tli travel channel to life,
One day we on the auto-bind swerving driving,
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands,
If y   with me ain't no time to sleep,
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach,
But I drive you off and pay y   no attention
If I make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention,
Then jump in the car and just ride for h   s,
Making sur/ I don't miss the homecoming at Howard,
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see,
So if y  asscdon't show up it'scmore women for me, Hey! [Chorus] [Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade,
Than at night I'm in New Orleans drinking hand Grenades,
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest,
In Mardi Gras all the women trying to show more They chest,
Hey I'm in Jamaica spending massive bucks,
While the ladies all begging me to masha tucks,
I had sad Beginnings when I rap wit no fans,
Now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Hey
I used to tlink that it was way too cold
Til I went to Canada and say some beautiful hoes,
Now I Hit the Caribbean every year in Toronto,
Then fly t Illinois to get a taste of Chicago,
Oh Yet and still y   wouldn't believe your eyes if y   went to Brazil,
Ain't no need of even asking Brah,
The best women are reside in Africa, and tlat's real [Chorus] [Ludacris]

Santa Claus comes to town The royal penis is clean your highness
Thank you, king shit Yeah motherfuckers! Welcome to the United States of America.
Time to roll out the red carpet on y'all bitch asses.
Hailing from the filthy, dirty South, where the Kings lay.
Ludacris, Disturbin' Tha Peace family. Recognize royalty
When y   hear it. The throne has been taken, so kiss this
Nigga's earring, Luda throw some grapes on these bitches! These bitches throwing rose petals at my feet man!
They want to spoil me, treating me like royalty,
What I'm supposed to do? It's such a sweet thing
Work that track, whip 'em like Kunta
That's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda
By way of A-T-L, if y   disagree
Don't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail
With no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly
It's Jolly Green Giants cause we smoke so much broccoli
Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's! Luda's oodles of noodles
And testing me is like pitbulls put up to poodles
My rap career goes back further than yo' father hairline
It's Ludacris, I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines
I'm fly, even when I get high I work cash
And even got my coats bumped up to first class
I'm boss to all employees, and I'm here to teach the principle
Cause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Vorhees Man fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man.

I throw a grenade and all-in-one bury a clique
Y   see y'all got it all wrong like women in tuxedos
And coming up shorter than five Danny DeVitos
I'm on a cool ranch, get laid more than Fritos
With five strippers, four wives and tlree amigos
I go scuba diving in Bays at Montego
I find gold links and snatch 'em like I'm Deebo
But I'm the light-skinned version of Mandingo
I've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo
I used to run numbers in line they called me bingo
Cause I'm big, y   a little star, y   just twinkle
Old asses like sharpeis, y'all all wrinkled
And I stay with more bullets than yo' Billboard singles Ho that is just too much! Y   just gotta give applause

See piece of the bigger trap look at that God be rolling on that
Where they kick it at? And a lot of people just don't know
Shady Park y   heard just don't go
Quick to flip the bird up po'-po'
Making the way for that rodeo, that rodeo show!
Gotta hit 'em with a reload, I gotta put 'em with the people
I gotta make a nigga stop, drop, roll, oh no where the beat go?
Bring that, shit back, didn't want to hear that, clik-clak
Tons of fun with guns

Stop and stare, pouring out a lil' gasoline and then drop a flare
Come on, fire! And y   know I can't stop 'til I retire!
Oh no, we stay swoll, rolling on Vogue tires!
Right down the avenue, passing y   rapidly stacking
In the back of the Cadillac typepacking emergency action
Camera, light lights, throwing a punch and then fight fight
Packing a lunch and then bite bite, A-T-L stay tight tight I'm just trying to save ya shorty.

Relax and take notes,
While I'm put y   up on game
Get a sweeter connect, then if I put y   up on cane,
But y   should grab yourself a seat and a whisky double,
Because the girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble,
They like a little danger and might not admit it,
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,
Plus they love a youn71Zhu71Zhat's overflowing with swag!
And keeps his women all draped in new louis vuitton bags!

Yea, we gonna take this to verse 2,
Now some of em wanna family, a sense of security,
Necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelery,
So, shop till y   drop, or till it makes y   psychotic,
Here's a triple black card, it ain't tricking if y   got it!
Others will stay content if y   just making 'em laugh,
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble batl,
So later on, they can dance and throw a dr34k in they hand,
And try any and everytling they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off y  r damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on y  r body that I'm trying to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on y  r mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if y  's invested in me,
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,
And for that!, I'll give y   everytling up under the sun,
Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
I know what y   fee: yes! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!
If y   cant take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen!
Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick,
Gets that ride or die pudding for that ride or die shit!
I say,
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!
So if y   cant take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen!
Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick,
Gets that ride or die pudding for that ride or die shit! [Chorus] [Bridge] They wanna go on vacation! I know it!
Lets go! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
Yes! they want what they can! [Ludacris]

Bet a million (put y ' money where y ' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put y ' money where y ' mouth is) [Ludacris]
Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they see-note stacks
Busting dominoes, spades, Cee-lo, craps
We shooting pool at the Luda-plex, I slap a hundred on the table
Just to see if any fools want to do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anytling that y   want to do
But come up short and oh the tlings1Zhat the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm making 'em sweat
Or put y  r house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if y   want some
Y   know the phrase, scared money don't make none! [Chorus] [Ludacris]
Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam I got a gambling problem
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's
Dru71away by the COPS, or when I'm blowing steam
Counting green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
All my people bring the strength to the block
Yes sir, I thought y   knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anytling, just to see if anybody's goin' do it
It's people living they life coming up off change
And hustlers paying they bills coming up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate, catch me out in A.C.
Calling y ' bluff with Puff eating cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put y  r dr34ks up to all compulsive gamblers [Chorus] [Ludacris]
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
Breaking the whole casino and doi471back-flips, man
Cameras eying us, sidebetters trying us
The more chips we stack, the more dr34ks they buying us
Trying to get me off my grind, but it won't work
Cause I can dr34k a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
I'm still breaking 'em, and dice still shaking 'em
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em [Chorus: x2] It's 2 am in the morning and it...uhhh...light showers

And, keep 'em drunk
Like Kathie Lee Curtis
And when y   shake it
Y   rock my world
I done died and
Went to heaven
Y   got a fatty girl [Chorus:] Okay, I remember the days
High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades
Troops, Lottos, and BKs, those was the days
Hi-tec boots spray painted witcha names
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial
Harris Photos, group shots, can y   remember?
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
F ' tle invasions of haters, man crews from all ar  nd
Used to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Key Lo
Rockin Damage, Cross Col  r and Paco
While playboys stepped in talent shows
Prom night, tux and Kangol was so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school) We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were y  n7
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that
Before they started jackin' jacks
F r notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin'
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
Want y  r Kool-Aid and sugar, smack y  r hands and say "sweat"
It's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Sl  ch socks, box Chevy Caprice
Hot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace
Wit no conscience, broke niggas call 'em non cents
No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin' homage to College Park We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were y  n7
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin' all that got damn noise, man We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were y  n7
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were y  n7
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids Yeah, we goin' send this one out
To everybody that put mo' into they cars tlan they do they relationship
Let's ride Two miles an h  r, so everybody sees y   [Repeat: x3]

[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Yes, 7 cars, 8 cribs and ain't a damn thing chang202I'm still pumping 10 kickers, still gripping the grain
Still candy in the paint, still riding them things
And most my folks would say I'm happy but I still feel pain
Until I, jump in my ride, that's my only escape
Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screaming, "Gimme a break!"
It's a pity how we turn   r city into obstacle c  rses
Don't be mad cause I can't hold my 500 horses
Lamborghini's and Porsche's, Ferrari's and Vipers
I'ma wipe the seats with you drool then rub the hood with a diaper
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank
I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap y  r seat-belts on, go put y  r money up
Go put y  r life on the line, go put y  r honey up
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
Time to play or better yet it's time to bring out them toys

Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on I'm making sure the slippers is clean
The 26's is mean, shut down the block, nigga picture the fiends
My system supreme, y   can feel the knock, just picture the scene
The chickens just scream, whole crew balling they sick of my team
We getting the cream, I'm through hollering, I'm living my dream
I'm black with a scheme, won't stop until that fat lady sings
And yeah it's actual and factual what my faculty brings
A car show for whatever we slide and wherever we glide
Y   can keep y  r rules and regulations man cause we don't abide
And we looking alive, Mercedes Benz, 6 or the 5
In a Beamer, Lexus or Ac', we don't know how to act when we drive
And I fiend for the ride, I lay back and lean to the side
Onlookers and turning heads is all that's seen through his eyes
I'm breezing on by, and no doubt, it's easy to fly
But it's even better when y   slow down or ease to the side
And go Two miles an h  r, so everybody sees y   [Repeat: x3]
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! I'm riding up in, GTO's, and fo'-fo'-two's
Grand Prix's, S-S's cause we so so cool
Riding Regal's or the 'llacs, we in Chevelle's and Vert's
Skylarks, motorcycles, ATV's with the works
Malibu's and Camaro's, T-Birds and Novas
Escalade's, Navigators, Expeditions and Rovers
H-2's and Denali's, pickup trucks with the beams
Crown Vics, Monte Carlos, even Cutlass Supreme's

Lets go shopping Cause a woman needs options and diamonds and pearls
Then go eat at the finest restaurants around the world
Drink from the finest grapes smoke from the finest leaves
Draped in the finest clothes I wanna put y  r mind at ease
A full body massage and then let's go catch a movie
Ahh fuck it lets go home and make a movie
Before we can hit the park go find a quiet spot

Now baby love y   eva prep
And full of class when y   a step
Soft supple and delicate
Bumper firm and heavy set
Every muckle a mickle make
Giggle, chuckle, every breath
Every freckle spot, every speck, I say, I say
Y  r performance commands respect
And buckle dance than y   expect
Nothing lesser than the best
And I'm a loving intellect
Cause I've th  ght out every step
Every building must erect
Nothing must be incorrect
Nutten mussin get neglect
Could separation separate
That would be inappropriate
There can be no surrogate
For the loving that I get
My cerebellum will not let
Nor allow me to forget

It's okay to check in that Motel 6

Then later on we'd be bonin'
Fat cats, I'm ready to tap that, so back that
No wonder why y   wakin' up up swollen I'm feelin' you Luda', smokin' my buddha, coochie recruiter
Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast
Hit it a h  r and a half, watch the spectacular splash
On the back and leave it drippin' down the crack of her ass
Call me Mr. Magilla-cutty, chasin' booty soft as silly putty
Killa for money, still a thug get bump
From slow pokin' to locomotion, hittin' bunnies, for threesomes getcha buddy
When I'm feelin' scummy I love to cut, 10-4 Thick skin so, butter soft I'm rippin' the buttons off y ' blouse
Smell the aroma of a dingaling king Ludacris when I'm in y ' h  se
Check the ratio of men to women and women to men when down south

So we love that c-c-c-c Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bo-22'em

We can get the mattress goin' 'eh-err, eh-err'
Handlin' business while I bang bang, skeet
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again
I can break 'em off in the shower, kitchen floor or the outdoors
The pieces from the East is the shit
And the flesh in the West is the best
But Twista love them Chicago and South hoes Come up out y ' negligee, freak 'em on a regular day
Cum six times, but it's seven today
Ludacris in the back of y  r Chevrolet
Ahh, ahh! What's my name?

You motherfuckers really lust to gain
Nothin' but hatin' and a look of disgust
Always a must, stay "Adrenaline Rush"
Wonderin' why they don't be bustin' the same I'm clutchin' my thang
Stufos;' in it, strokin' it down, beat the stufo up
Uh-uh shorty, don't run from it
She give me the booty I'm breakin' it off

Fatty flickin' like it was dubs on it
Peep how this player got skills, get 'em out the gator high heels

Freaky thangs, we be bo-22'em

Makin' you stutter from the b-body butters and backrubs
It's killin' me thinkin about the bottles that pop
The models that swallow willin', up under my pillow stayin strapped up
If it tickles in the middle from Mr. Pickles y   try to escape
So give me the rope y   gettin' wrapped up
Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh, I'm fresh and fruity
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin' slapped up I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
Long as I can still grab her legs, and push 'em up by her head
How I dip up in it we can make a video
But I got the radio bumpin' Jagged Edge by the bed
When y   wanna get up witcha cutty buddy
Come on and dip off through the hideout with Twist'
But after we do what we gon' do get ya purse and get tonfoher
Because now y   gots to ride out, bitch Oh 'Cris, can y   do it again, that's what they askin' me

If men sleep around we some players but for women
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
If men sleep around we some players but for women
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho Now I be riding in my Bentley coupe stuntin' with the top down
F  r twenty four inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
Twenty four carrot necklace so heavy it hurt my neck
Three things y   can't take away from me, money, power and respect
I got it and hold on to it y   knew that I never let it go
Y   prostitute it but money I never let it ho
Speakin' of hoe's oh yes we meet em and we G' 'em dude
And we may see 'em but we wouldn't want to be 'em dude
I put my fist up, I got the power girl
I wash my nuts off, go take a shower girl
It's been an hour girl, it's time to go
And if my neighbor see you while you walking out my door (hey ho)
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho [Chorus] Can't nobody do it like Kim
Only women that can do it like men
V-V-S is be them gems
(Ho, now count that)
My money coming in
Bringing them corners on them rims
So play the check book tell me how do y   bounce that
I bounce into position like I am vinegar Kama Sutra
But money make me come, go and ask Luda'
And women cheat better than men we don't disturb them
My motto is "what they don't know won't hurt them"
We just do it like y   do, see the roles done switched
If I'm a ho y  's a ho, if I'm a bitch y  's a bitch
Know that I'ma stay rich so fella's do what y   do
Cause y   don't fuck us niggas we fuck y   [Chorus] (Hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)

Now we saying (hey ho) If men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying

If men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying She likes the night lights, brights lights, big spending
Lil Fate been big pimpin', pimpin'
So don't be mad at my raps and try and look at me funny
Cause y   know that most y   ladies trading sex for money
So if y   coming out the pocket then y   might get laid
That's how the rent car no the cell phone get paid
I bet the snakes all show once y   cut that grass
And I'm a pimp so it's time that I exploit they ass
Y   see it's hoes after the party it's hoes after the show
It's hoes up in the lobby, it's hoes out on the stroll
Here's some no dough, no dough, no sleep
Ho on your feet, if y   don't work y   don't eat [Chorus] [Intro: Miguel]
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on y  
Especially when y   had hoes and area codes on y  
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in y  r heart, I never intended to make y   hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout "that's supposed to be you, girl" [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and y  r exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when y   hit the bottom
After y   break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive y   crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So y   know what I need [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Young Jeezy:]
On 285, I don't know where I'm goin' on 285, I drink when I drive
I just love when I'm high, I don't know here I'm goin', on 285, on 285, on 285 [x2] [Ludacris:]
I come equipped with 2 straps on my lap move back 45 tucked by my side
Sip a little bit of this, sip that drink up I'm so drunk when I drive.
I'm wood grain, grippin' 'n tippin' on some 24's.
I puff the magic dragon & then blow smoke out of my nose
I try to tell em ain't nothin' change but the mileage on the range
It's baby powder white an I whip it like cocaine
All up an down 285 an I'm goin' around in circles man
My partners call me prince cause they know I got that purple rain
Burners along my waist belt, gotta put up my pants like I'm urkel man
My girlfriend said   sure I said bitch I'm for certain man
I'm hurtin' the game so bad they can't keep up when I count this skrilla
My momma quit her job cause I got her workin' with six figures
Yes she's workin' with six figures 'n niggas is workin' like some slaves
She retired a little bit early because her son is fukin paid
And she ain't gotta do shit but be rich an stay alive
And once in awhile just take her Lexus an drive on 285 [Chorus x 2]
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today (slap, slap)
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today (slap, slap)
Slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today This morning I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)
I don't really wanna work; I'm tired
I hate my nine to five
And I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today
Killin' my boss today
I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today (it's just a thought, man)
Killin' my boss today (yeah) Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Somebody came and took his life (life)
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have y   ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm asking, why did y   take him away?
Why did y   take him away?
I'm asking, why did y   take him away? (Why'd y   take him?)
Why did y   take him away? (Hey) I need some money please (please)
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)
'Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today
I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today (real talk) Baby mama's at home and fussin' (fussin')
Callin' up my mobile, cussin' (cussin')

But she really don't be talkin' 'bout nothin'
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Take my pain away (please)
Somebody take my pain away (hey)
Take my pain away (I can't take it) [Chorus: x2] Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)
Snatched  p everything inside (inside)
Even got my forty-five
How am I supposed to survive
When I know that my stereo's taken away
Stereo's taken away?
When I know that my stereo's taken away (I need my music, man!)
Stereo's taken away (hey) Gas pricetiore way too high
Rich people are way too fly
And I'm where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away
Wasting my time away?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away (too lazy)
Wasting my time away? (I can't help it) My grand mama's nerves ore bad (bad)
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)
'Cause President Bush could give a damn about our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (Don't say nothin')
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say (woo) Troops gone, and we still at war (war)
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store
'Cause y   know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised, man)
Tomorrow's not promised today
'Cause y   know that tomorrow's not promised today
(Live like today could be y  r last, man!)
Tomorrow's not promised today (hey) [Chorus: x4] Yo hello, Luda

Last summer, got the hook up
Y   know what I did
Who'd ever thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids
Type of rat, sat on my ass
And fiendin' for cash
Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass
Now what we got 'round here is a 20-20 twins
and whats up in my hand, is a bottle of Gin
I love women so I'm in it to win it
In it to green
In it to get in it and get in it again
Y   got two bootietiso you whipping yo chin
And I don't blame you
I lay in the sand, y'all lay in the snow and make angels
My ice piece dangle
make my chest look older
Touch it and fall apart like yo High school folder
I'ma Trojan man, BHS hall supplier
Shady park resident and southside Rider [Chorus] Get back, time to get hood jacked
Gold chain, took that
World of Ghetto fabulous Dopeboys and Hoodrats
Be careful what y   look at
cause y   looking to long
Y   might go blind in my briefs cause my dick is too long
I'm getting nutt while I'm singin thitisong
and there is enough for everybody in da party
while y'all hitting th bong
But y'all be hitting my schlong
y   play the flute quite nicely
When teeth interrupt, y   can watch as I get fietty
Oh no, y   suckers didn't request back up
Broads I seem to rack up
When I pull the gold actor
Get slapped  p
Drove up the wall
Put it in Reverse
y   can hope for the best, but expect the worst
You at a place like some D's on a Hurst
Its quite funny
Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny
It seemtios if that's what I need
Filthy south and D's
That's why I roll in from the Southside breeze
Give it to me now [Chorus] Your pick time to get hood sick
Hit'em wit a good lick
Clean out yo house from the couch to the toothpick
EastSide Ruthless
WestSide leave 'em clueless
My Northside mackers got dis broads acting foolish
And do this for a living
while you stuck up in yo cubicle
Nightlife running ditistreets, it sounds beautiful
Women break a cuticle
Ballas break bread
Southside, I represent it till I'm dead
What what [Chorus: x2] Turn the lights off I be representin', representin'
I be representin', representin' Luda, yeah y   representin' for bad bitches all around the world
The way y   put it down in between the sheets is like no other girl
Y   done take it a whole another level of freakiness When y   blow my mind
To the point where all these other women Kinda feelin' like you stole their shine
So I better come with it,
Ha, and I better come split it
And I admit that I'm feeling a little pressure, when y  're telling me I better come get it
Ha but I'm the man for the job
Can't nobody do it quite like I do

Body is so angelical, a rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to I'll take y   how y   coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it's not that many
Y   give me that good and plenty And I walk around all day grinin'
My mind and body are gone

Watch how I put it down
I be representin', I be representin' (I'm representin')
I be representin' I be representin' (I'm representin')
Watch how I put it down When all y  r love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't y   let me know
Or give me one more reason to go When all y  r love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't y   let me know
Or give me one more reason to go I done took all I could take from y  
Need a little bit more than a break from y  
Matter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life
Y   done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense, I did all I could do
Y   just took me for granted, y   thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please y  
But I don't know y   no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry
And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga y  's a grown man, get yourself together
Forget about the past, now's a better time than never
Matter of fact, it's time to start making better decisions
So put yo r fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges
You little bitches When all y  r love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't y   let me know
Or give me one more reason to go Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters
And all this time y   thought y   had me fooled niggas
In my Ferrari, partner thought he saw a spaceship
'Cause I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall
Is it cause y  'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better, y   fail at business endeavors?
Or that people thought y   were clever, but now they know y   stupid?
And misery loves company now that yo 're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis
So get out of here, y   don't want no parts in this shit, do we?
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon
So while y   contemplate making yo r first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then, trillion When all y  r love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't y   let me know
Or give me one more reason to go The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers or principals
For y   to know it's not the money, it's the principle
So I can't expect y   to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out
Niggas is fighting inside, we can't just walk 'em out
These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out
As if y   know what I'm talkin' 'bout When all y  r love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't y   let me know
Or give me one more reason to go Did some movies and started missing this rap shit
Back to rap then starting missing them movies
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
Get with one chick started missing them groupies
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybody's after all of my ends
(Get yo hand out my pocket!)
When I was broke all love from my folks
But nowadays I'm losing all of my friends, let the story begin The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit
When I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what I'm really saying The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground
Got underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)
When y   down and people give y   the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
Y   cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know y  r neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)
We always searching what we never had
Always ignoring what's in front of o r face
We've been conditioned to think The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away [Gucci mane]
Hey how y   doin, Ms. Lady? Y   so fine with it
I know y   handlin business, can I get yo r 5 minutes?
Dont be offended by me telling yo  y   thick with it

s Gucci [Ludacris - Verse 1]
That waist got a swivel to it
But that ass a Cali earthquake jiggle to it
She a stallion, no horseshit
Y   could fit that bitchs booty on a forklift
Beep! Beep! Bitch back it up
I put my balls on the table, tell her rack em up
Vanilla bed sheets, chocolate laid one way
Sprinkle my nuts on top what a sundae, hey
Whipped cream cherry on top
And when I aint wit her, p-ssy on lock
Throw away the key, its a rap bitch!
Large shake and a Ludacris sandwich [Hook] [Gucci Mane]
Yo, mama turned out, she so popular
Y   suckers cant see her with binoculars
Shell suck y  r pocket dry like Dracula
Her last boyfriend bought her an Acura
Dont try to get all attached to her
She an alley-cat type that chickll scratch y   up
Like Bel Biv DeVoe said, Shes dangerous
Her old man used to snort   gel dust
So, dont be quick to judge, shorty bad as f-ck
Shes the type that drive back with the bricks for bucks
She had a ballplayer dude but she f-cked him up
He bankrupt, selling cars like an auctioner
Its Gucci [Hook] [Ludacris]
Ive got a sausage for them hot cakes
And I be f-ckin while y   niggas out on hot dates
Y   all polite and open doors for her
While every night I put that blanket on the floor for her
These hoes be sprintin like its track n field
Because this supersize dick is their Happy Meal
So for an extra value woody
Put this Big Mac into that Quarter-Pound p-ssy, yes!
Its Ludacris Mr. Slay-A-Bitch
Unless that p-ssy is smelling like a Filet-O-Fish
Shoo Fly, ho! Kick the bucket
And niggas talking shit I bust em in their chicken nugget [Hook] When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me I'm a motherfuckin' beast (When the liquor get up in me)
Tell these niggas clear the streets (When the liquor get up in me)
I'll be all up in my zone (When the liquor get up in me)

Get lit (Get lit)

These haters want my paper and the snakes is out to get me
So when I leave this bitch I'm taking everything with me
With my wrist glowing and my fist throwing
And my Lamborghini Aventador sneak it on the block
Been going and I been flowing I gotta say that Ludacris, a nigga never gonna stop
Hanging with women that's loving them drugs
Neighborhood call me the plug of the plug
Poppin' a pill and then jump in the tub
We buy out the bar, we buy out the club
Got a black, AMX, I left home, no Visa
Talk money, and my money, talk back, like Caesar
Mix soda, with the syrup, we be leaning like the Tower of Pisa
And if y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all either I'm a motherfuckin' beast (When the liquor get up in me)
Tell these niggas clear the streets (When the liquor get up in me)
I'll be all up in my zone (When the liquor get up in me)

How many shots to hit the motherfucking floor
Y   sipping man, quit tripping man, stop acting like a ho
Waitress said another round? I said y   already know Y   see I started from nothing and made it up outta the hood
Dollar and a dream and I made what I could
Fifty to a hundred, then a hundred to a grand
Then a grand to a milli, nigga really what's good
It's wood in the whip the wood like a wood shop
Neighbor's all think that I cook rocks
No peace in the streets
Really got me thinking ain't no such thing as a good cop
My neck froze and no ice steel
Flows, rappers just bite still
Platinum plaques, three Grammy's
I tell y   I Made It like Mike Will
With coupes all on that freeway
Pockets on Gabby Sidibe
Got cake and women blowing like everyday is my b-day We be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)
She be sliding down that pole (When the liquor get up in her)
She be shaking it for daddy (When the liquor get up in her)
Getting freaky in the Caddy (When the liquor get up in her) Get lit (Get lit)

Ah shit She dragging a mink coat, got Peter pissed, it's a pity
A titan like Tennessee but she chiefing like Kansas City
She love it when she get tipsy and strip to the core essentials
With her legs sprawled out like the Air Jordan symbol
She be twenty thousand feet in my apartment in the sky
Y'all hoes just drink and drive, my woman just drink and fly
She a lady in the street ain't nothing fake about her booty
She call me for special ops, I told her that's my Call of Duty She be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)
She be sliding down that pole (When the liquor get up in her)
She be shaking it for daddy (When the liquor get up in her)

I done killed so many niggaz in the booth I sell rappers on ebay,
Soldiers couldn't cause more disaster on D-Day,
Haters better cover up they jaw like freeway,
Cause every hit records spit instant like replay,
Hold the line I got ya momma on 3-way,
Tell her Ludas got more records than the DJ,
Tell her she should blow me like candles on ya B-Day,
Cause I've signed more lines then she's passed on the freeway,
More checks then y   ever could imagine more wood up in my whip then in a forest full of cabins,
And yes I stay high on that purple like Aladdin,
And Women say I talk more game than John Madden,
How'd it happen how the let me in the booth,
How they let these rappers lie how dare I tell the truth!
I'm the truth and these other boys phony, it's a movie so act like ya know me. I'm A lyricist to the death so I got what ya need, Ludacris,

Spittin' at ya head full of bread like toaster,
Never had a holster, I keep it on my lap,
And Hip Hop aint dead it just had a heart attack,
What yo  see I keep it pumpin yeah I got that hard back,
So just call me Little Carter or Little Cardiac,
Precious like a artifact, Valuable like a quarterback,
Hannible like they call me jack, Fall back like a starter hat,
Nah did he thought of that,
I mean how did he think of that,
I mean how did I think of that, Now like a rental bring it back,
I mean how did I think of that, I surprise myself sometimes,
Someone should throw me a surprise party for every line,
Every time I do what I do I do it dirty like swine for the dirty and fine hip hop I'm alive! I'm a lyricist to the death and I got what ya need, Weezy F,
The last ofa dying breed, and we almost extinct so I'm saying it loud,
Say it with me (Mcs move the crowd) [Repeat x3] [Ludacris]
This is music muscle mania, my verses on steroids,
Private planes I'm on the jet son like Elroy,
Flying through the sky at amazing speed,
We on that superman kush or that amazing weed,
The new Bentley came out my team said LUDA GET IT,
Twenty thou says that I'm the only nigga WIT IT,
New Era on ya brain like a A-Town Fitted,
And I'm not E-40 but I'm so sick wit it,

Hoes I gotta view, but I'm stingy with the dough I'm like no not for you,
What the fuck was y   thinking?
Off what I'm banking, Me and Wayne on that lean what the fuck was y   drankin?
Stinkin' like a dead body up in the woods,
So I stashed it like a weave coming up in the hood,
And if y   down for no bad then we up to no good,
And it's important that yo  make it understood I'm a lyricist to the death so I got what ya need, Ludacris,
The last of a dying breed, and we almost extinct so I'm saying it loud,
Say it with me (MCs move the crowd) [Repeat x3] Cry me a river, cry me, cry me, oh

Then I wanna, yo  make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's y  r fantasy I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
And if y   like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up y  r thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man ain't Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em
I'll let 'em free
And the tell me what's they fantasy
Like up on the roof roof tell yo boyfriend not to be mad at me I wanna, lick yo  from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, yo  make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's y  r fantasy I wanna, lick yo  from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, yo  make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's y  r fantasy I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit yo  give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
'Cause yo  know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream yo  can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But yo  can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause yo  know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name
Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet I wanna, lick yo  from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's y  r fantasy I wanna, lick yo  from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, yo  make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's y  r fantasy I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way y   like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe y  r girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains I wanna, lick yo  from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, yo  make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's y  r fantasy I wanna, lick yo  from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, yo  make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's y  r fantasy I wanna, lick yo  from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, yo  make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's y  r fantasy I wanna, lick yo  from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, yo  make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's y  r fantasy I want to (Diamond in the back)

Wonderin' how I can get me some
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses
But please, stay away from the hoes and snithes
And I was always reached for the sky, I don't know why
I'ma little bitty kid wit' a whole bunch of gangsta wishes
When I grow up, yo  just wait, I'ma be so straight
And everything's gonna be so marvelous
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
I'ma have it made in the shade, I'ma be so paid
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills
Matter fact I'm schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good
When I ditch these trainin' wheels I want to (Diamond in the back)

Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels
I'm willin' to do 20Si it takes, whatever the stakes
In order to get myself some dollar bills
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss
My older cousin need some cheddar too
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
Ii involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
And whatever they do, don't let the owner know
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he don't let me borrow nothing, but ask me what I want
I'ma tell him I wanna I want to (Diamond in the back)

And I want to (Sunroof top)
I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) Why can't I walk with a limp mama? won't be no drama
For goodness sakes, I'm just a kid
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'
Like there no remorse for what I did
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal
"I could of swore it was mine," what I used to tell the po-pos
What I left to rob and steal
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin'
Find somethin' I love to do
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls
I'm adjustin' to my environment
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back
Why can't work feel like retirement? I want to (Diamond in the back)
I want to (Sunroof top)

They don't know what they want that's why I tell yo  put yo r trust in me.
Share all yo r secrets, all yo r desires and yo r fantasies.
I ain't gon' tell nobody, baby I'm an only child.
I'd keep it to myself cause all I wanna do is see yo  smile,
Knowin' that yo  got someone to talk to ain't that what yo  want?
I'll be yo r lover, yo r provider, and yo r confidant.
And I won't judge yo  cause I know that ain't nobody perfect,
But yo  got some perfect imperfections that makes yo  worth it.
I wanna see yo body in all the positions that yo  like ii in,
We could do it slow or have some drinks, it gets in enticing when,
Yo  like ii rough I give ii rough and I start to pull yo r hair,
Cause ecstasy's yo r destination and I'ma take yo  there,
Tell me a secret baby Tell me somethin' that nobody else knows,

Tell me all the things yo  would do if it was yo  and me,
Tell me a secret baby.
Tell tell tell me a secret baby And there ain't nobody in the universe t0Si competes with you,
Imagine all the possibilities and the freaky things that we could do.
Blind folded,
Handcuffed to the head board never let yo  go until yo  scream my name,
Maybe yo  think I'm playin' but this is really far from a mothafuckin' game.
Ain't a damn thang changed still nasty as I wanna be.
And I got just what yo  want baby girl yo  want it,
See it'll turn yo  on and it's gonna be on as soon as I take it off.
Just give me yo r body its guaranteed that I'ma

And I'm not here to disappoint just give me one try.
One kiss one pinch and yo  could take it or leave it,

Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Tell me a secret
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa Wake uuuuuuuup
I see the sun shine gazing threw window pain
Blazing like indo flame its time to wake up
Co0me to ur senses manye
Snow is all around yo 
But yo  dont play no winter games
Cartrage all around yo 
But yo  dont play netendo games
Load them up and fill them up to the top
Before yo  cocking them
Trying to get from the botton to the top
Like the stock exchange
See I was shitting shaving
Hit the coner for a block exchange
Amazing what my people would do
For some pocket change
But maybe this aint the life yo  choose
This is the life yo  stay strapped and pack a knife
Or end up with a bloody nose
Street survival or survival of the street
And only the strong survive
There's no survival for the weak
Catch a sneak eak at death if ur not on ur p's & q's
They carry banana clip and niggas will peel u for ur shoes
This is the blues but not all hill street
U can call it kill or be killed street
Lost a pint of blood let it spill street
Stop and wake uuuuuuuuuup
Wake uuuuuuuuuup They say my folkes would do any thing for the fortune and fame
And it will take a fortune to get rid of all the pain
But im saying use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
Use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
Yo  say the only family u got is in the game
And the only way to make is by sell cocain
But im say use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
Use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya) Hi, my name's Ludacris, and I'm high as giraffe pussy
And I'm close to the edge, so yo' parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids "Actin' a Fool" from the traps to the burbs My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and took my old teeth back
I'll take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin
I go fishin' on my lake, with yo' bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MC's, but I don't gain no weight The number one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers
I'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas
But my trick ain't for kids, if yo  dig 'em, you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya, I'll spring forward, you fall back Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
That's cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools is Crank Yankers
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine Now I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with Rastas
For a hefty fee, I'm on yo r record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full court press So momma toast yo r glass while I'm countin' my cash
'Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass
The competition never just want to admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in the wash From yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit' yo 
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than yo 
So by the time you figure out why yo r record ain't spinnin'
I'm in the strip club smokin', with President Clinton So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They may the mold of the penis enlarger off me
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq So yippie-kay-yay, yippie-yie-yie-yo
If yo  can't swim, don't smoke my hydro
I've been lookin' for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons So wash all ya sins away and stop playin'
If God's line is busy yo  might have to two-way him
Then catch me in yo r backyard, playin' croquet
And when I'm drunk tell them kids, "Drugs are bad, mmm'kay?" Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
Got seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think I'm bad, they say "Oooh he's so evil!"
'Cause I go on blind dates, with actual blind people But my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf
I heard yo  masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home All that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them
'Cause Ludacris will beat yo  down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in yo' ass that yo  can smell it
And yo' breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellent I'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see
And I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me and me
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
So I'm a trade my earrings in, and get a Ferrari I buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump
y'all meet with Honda, no payments for 12 months
Take a look at yo' life and no wonder yo  so sad
Y'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag, fool! So I'm just sitting in this rehab class
Trying to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question

Half bent, black tint, fine pussy make it a little hard to see me
Stepped out, fresh out headed straight for the door and to the VIP
Next thing I got a text from a freaky Latina saying is that yo  I see

Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? I'm still back for the first damn time
So grab a hold of yo r seats while I open yo r mind
And take yo  back to when I dropped down from heaven
And I came out my moms and had a mic as my fucking weapon
When I was three I was just a little G
But if yo  looked in my eyes you'd see the future of a real MC
And at the age of nine I wrote my first rhyme
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pastimes
Every where that I went spitting and babbling
Showing my ass, growing up then started traveling
From one city to the next, Luda landed in the ATL
Where the pimps and the players dwell
I made a tape, did shows and got exposure
And kept learning as my black ass got older
No matter what I just kept at my trade
I made mistakes but stayed sharper then a Ginsu blade It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Age fo rteen, my talent show a beast outta cage
I would of won but disqualified for jumping off stage
But I ain't care, cause this game has started to open it's arms
When I was at Banneker High School pulling fire alarms
So I could get a crowd around me, make a name for my block
People told me "keep flowing," they ain't want me to stop
Was back when Big Nose John was my human beat box
We'd skip school, hit open campus and watch out for street cops
Now I'm known around the town as that nigga that raps
From the hills that made high to them G roll traps
And I was still making demo's, perfecting the craft
And some said I wouldn't make it, they would giggle and laugh
So I picked up a co ple books by Donald Goins
Bout the business of this shit, how to flip a few coins
Before the age of eighteen, I was destined to make it
My bank account read Disturbing The Peace, incorporated It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Age eighteen, I'm strugglin', just to survive
But got a gig workin' for change at 97.5
Now I'm rapping on the radio, increasing their numbers
Still Ludacris but alias was Cris Luva Luva
Late nights I'm in they studio and using they tools
Me and Puma smoking weed and breaking all of their rules
And I was krunk, all the big wigs was hearing my songs
But nobody did shit and they was taking too long
So three years went past, and I saved enough cash
To make my own record label and put myself on blast
The album was independent, it was just for the streets
I sold a one thousand copies in my first fuckin' week
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand
All the record companies bite me, but I chose Def Jam
And the main reason that I made it and I love the A-town
Was 'cause the block had its eye brows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Yea-uh, here we go here we go here we go
Talk about that Word of Mouf baby
Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what yo  want now now now now Check it
Yo  see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
Yo  pricks is all talk, and it's bad for yo r health
See I ain't gotta say shit, money speaks for itself
With all models I make I'm great like five lakes
Yo  got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates
Yo  rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirty as home with more rings than ya tub
Yo  think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a co ple of girls that shaking they thangs
Then I put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be going to Hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail
I got Junkyard Dogs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, 'cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So yo  can pray for now if yo  sinned in the past
"Word of Mouf" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass These rap cats is soft like R&B; singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggas one by one
Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworking
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurking
Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
Yo  want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rolls with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I Alter Beast
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass, (it's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
System on blast, cops just pass
Just seen a big ol' ass, (it's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky Grease don't pop on the stove no more, moved on up
Double shot Hennessey fill my cup
Luda choke smoke in a big black truck
Should I wild out, what the fuck?
Act like my rims ain't clean
How yo  gonna act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like afro-sheen
But they don't never really wanna pop them things
Cane, cane sugar man Luda don't go
And I stop at a light, pull off so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that dro
So, daddy come home in a Cadillac brome, Cadillac brome
Now don't it sound absurd
Claim College Park where they flip them birds
Trick car alarms, then bend them curves
Chop chop, chunk it up fat man herb I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash

Sticky, icky, icky, icky It's illegal but the plants in my backyard grow, that's my bud
Smoke 'til ya drop out, that's my luck
Keep a co ple rolled and I hit the club in the back door, nigga what?
Act like I don't make cloud, how yo  gonna act like I don't get loud?
How yo  gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But, I guess what yo  don't really know don't hurt
With a vest, and a pump hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work (they got that work)
Don't it smell so good, in Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect yo r chest, they up to no good
And come through flossing, they wish y'all would I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash

Keep a D eagle with an extra clip
Think it ain't so, suck a dick!
Act like I just do rap
How yo  gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How yo  gonna act like I don't push lacs?
Black Eldorado, fifth wheel on back!
Ichy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a glock I'ma make 'em say please
In the back, on the block so the cops they freeze
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed, yo  gotta nose bleed?
Don't it smell so sweet?
In Decatur, where they pack that heat
And rob neighbors in the night creep, creep
I'll see yo  later we'll be in them streets I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash

Chinese splits-splits slide on down that pole-pole
And feel this dick-dick getting out of control-trol
Oh no keep going till a nigga like me say stop
Let it kiss the sky and then make it drop
Tuck and twist if yo  don't like it, you're fuckin' Cris
I'm rubbing clits so stay and catch don't try to duck and miss

Yo  got me moving, in fact yo  doing the damn thing

Trying ta be that bitch, can't no bitch come fuck wit me
When I pop that Cris I'm only business and bubbly
When I'm in the 6 wit 20's spinning I'm luxury
'Cause I got that head game
Fuckin' up that bed frame
But don't get me wrong, shawty gon' let that lead aim
Better learn that game shawty
Better get yo r man shawty
'Fore he end up tamed and be gone all in the brain shawty
This here be futuristic
This business so explicit
The way I break it down for yo  bitches, it's so explicit
Let it go now front, back, watch me drop it like that
Show me where the money at
Boy come wit them hunnid stacks
Breakin' wit that pussy popping

Smokin' purple, potent, green shit got everybody geeked
In the club 7 days a week, find DTP up in this beesh
That ho popping, dropping, Goddamn shawty who is this?
Redbone wit a Scorpio tatted on her tummy
I'm sitting slouched back in the chair, stunting, waving money
And shawty star, zig zagging her derriere for me
A bowlegged thoroughbred and said her name was "Strawberry"
Up her pussy, shawty pushed in a whole bottle of Moe'
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the flo'
"Here, yo  deserve this doe. Now jump on stage and work a pole"
Face down, ass up hoe, hands on poles
Now pop that coochie, yo  know the procedure
If yo  want this cash, gotta make that ass shake like a seizure
Either magic or please us
Find me spending cheese up
Maxing out my visa
Tricking on strip teasers Head down, pussy pussy popping

Go to sleep, hoe to sleep, go to sleep, hoe to sleep
If yo 're tired be quiet and go to sleep, hoe to sleep Man, I tell a hoe to go to sleep (go to sleep)
They turn around and frown, gotta make 'em six feet deep
'cause we knock 'em unconscious with that non-sense
Read in between that fine print, think about lyrical con-tent
Then about where yo r time spent
Mess around get yo r guys hit, a ten hut!
I send three-six ol' shit, nigga what?
If ya tired ya tired, if ya snooze ya lose
But'chu yo  won't wrap up ya bandages, or hell yo  would Nigga I got shotty's and semi's, I love 'dro and henne' ?
All brown and skinny, but I've fucked up so many
I got qp's and halves, if we beefin' I blast
Yo  sleepin' I laugh, ask 'cris, I'm off the rip
I had this hoe who talked too much, I had to off the bitch
2-0, Mr. Crayola, niggas know what I mean
'cause I slang brown, white, yellow, purple and green
And all yo  fagot-muthafuckas gotta know the routine [Chorus: x4] Bitch it's me again, kickin' in your fuckin' doors
I look for div-idends, I ain't lookin' for yo  hoes
Yo  bitch can't com-prehend, let me put one in your boot
Let me put one in your boat, so yo  ? can go to sleep
So, lay down bitch, gimme all that yo  dreamed for
Gimme fancy cars, gimme bling-bling-bling, boi
It don't mean a thing, boi, for me that ain't gon' swing, boi
Them god damn toys, do yo  know what I mean, boi? Now if yo  warrin' and runnin' from them three-six niggas
This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga
Or bustin' massive 'round some s.k.
My last trip to a-t-l I fucked yo' cascade
I'm strippin' bitches and I'm a ball fucker with a limp
They call me infer-stripper, sexy, red hoe's pimp
And quick to sink her on the nigga 'cause this what it's 'bout
We rob that trick and stick his dick off in his fuckin' mouth
We memphis niggas [Chorus: x4] North, north, south, south, westwood, orange mouth
Nigga we be smokin' life, never shut ya charlie brown
Memphis niggas in this bitch, pockets full, ya know we bail
Hooked up with my nigga 'cris, then we head to a-t-l
Playas wild, throwin' bows, tellin' chickens, "fuck yo  hoe!"
Nigga rollin' up the moe, as long that white shit up they nose
Mayn this town is like my town, so we stayed and hung around
Juicy j be high as fuck, catch me in the lost and found Better use common sense checkin' me out for bitch I can stand for
And up, get yaself in this clique
Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut
Look, I'm from gittero what?
Southside niggas throw it up when it's time to get buck
Niggas in the back of the club postin' up
Waitin' for a nigga that's new to make it up
Ass in, ain't no askin', it's no tolerance as long bitch check in
She wit' me, comments will only get'chu basically eternally resting
So abide by the call of the streets
If ya got a bitch better keep her on a leash
? gonna creep in ya home while yo  gone
Have yo  comin' back findin' nutt on yo' sheets [Chorus: x4] I'm never goin' nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me
Respected highly, Hi MR. O'Reilly
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded reppin' harder since Ice-T
Yo  disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What yo  doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Readyas/Gbreak the steerin' column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm double-X-L so I call 'em my "Eye Candy"
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What yo  doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women tryin' yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly!"
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin' like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ah, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)

Yo  gonna see this big ass white mansion on the right hand side
Word?, Hell, yea, there gonna be a convertable Jag in the driveway
What?, Range Rover, all black, hell, yea Shit, now, We like right next door an' shit in this hud house
Yea the door kinda fucked up so you're gonna have to, uh
Climb through the window, is that cool?
What the fuck? Hell, no, nigga Hey, yeah! I want all yo  proud sisters to stand up
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
Brothers and Sisters if yo  know yo  got yo r thing together
I want yo  to stand on up, now I got somethin' to tell ya'
I told ya' how to think about it, now I want to tell how to get the thing together
So come on now and get up to it y'all The incredible, untouchable nigga spittin' venom out his body wit' the dopest flows
And wonder why the line's around the corner
Cause the little motherfucker has the dopest shows
So one time for my independent women and all the single mothers who be gettin' that cake
Two times for my dogs pullin' triggers
And my niggaz in the kitchen that be flippin' that weight
East coast, west coast, mid west, dirty south
Then we took it all around the world
I got fans in retirement homes, to teenagers,as/Glittle bitty boys ans girls
Droppin' lyrical bombs up in ya' hood,
Non-stoppin', I'ma hit 'em till the block explode
Hip hop, R&B;, Pop-tart, what yo  want?
I even got a little rock 'n' roll
The most creative, original, got 'em takin' subliminal Cause they can't get what I got's
They want it s/Gbad, fo r million dollar pad
And enough to retire off two albums, gone, wave ya' white flags, I'm hot!
And everytime I rhyme I'm puttin' rappers in the ground
Wit' lines that got 'em hooked like dope
They gotta make up they mind, because they runnin' outta time
And I'm about to make 'em choke
Better turn yo r stere/Glouder, listen up and let me preach
Let's get arrested for Disturbin' the Peace! (C'mon) Man! This Disturbin' Tha Peace shit gettin' on my nerves
Boy I tell yo  the truth, know what I'm sayin'?
While he doin' shows, I'm in these streets, know what I'm sayin'?
While he on tv, I'm in these streets
And then my broad, my kid walkin' around singin' it
Boy, if they sing another verse, boy I swear
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm on another level though
I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National
I got my own record label, yo  heard of us
The Posse Family Cartel, yo  know what I'm sayin', we real
Who this nigga thing he is? I'ma house hold name, wit' game spittin' outta my mouth at all times
I spit it out and about, and spit outta the south,until they recognize the danger signs
So feel a tingle in yo' s-spine, by the way I talk
And it's pimpin' in my blood, you can tell by the way I walk
Oh lawd, more styles than a barber shop, call the cops
People in the way want to baller block
Little do they know that I'm callin' shots
And I'm not to be fucked with
If yo  see me comin' 'round the corner, then duck quick, perpetrators can suck dick
I tried to tell 'em, but they don't want to listen
I tried to shine 'em, but they don't want to glisten, while the high hat keeps on tickin'
And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools
Cause rules were made to be broken, but you can't make broken rules
Hear what I'm sayin' or heard what I said
Hear what they playin', 'cause through this music I'ma still be heard if I'm dead
Call ya' producers,a'cause I'm hurtin' these beats
I said it once, I'll say it twice, biatch, Disturbin' Tha Peace
C'mon "1"/>

Pull out the roach, roll up the dough, money I'ma throw again holla at my folk
All I need is a bitch right now, to blow me away then take me down
I need another fuckin Conjure round, hot wing, Gucci, out to the lounge
You might just see me but I can't dig deep nigga with gold teeth
Nigga then O-D on VSOP, and if not now slowly but surely
Shake 'em like LeBron, shoot 'em like Kobe, if they say chill I just pay the police
In the club chillin with G-S-U-P, but after go down it's in D.T.P.
That's a rock, got yo  pissy and you dizzy, wanna hit me
But not really, please don't mix me, I'm a boss, my dogs bite quickly
If nobody's out here with me I'ma do this shit myself
Smoke and drink off for my health like I don't need nobody else
Scrap's so true to smokin crucial, swishin on swishas with Luda
I'm, in the Playas Circle, this G shit yo  hoes ain't used ta
I got my own kush pack and got my own liquor
"Ay what yo  call that?" I call it Cleveland
Now nigga! [Chorus:Repeat x7] I know everybody remember their first time
No matter how old yo  are
Yo  gotta remember that very first time you did s/mething man Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories (I remember, I remember)
Ain't nothing like the first time (ok)
or how things used to be (how they used to be girl)
Ain't nothing like the first time (hey mom I'm coming in I won't be too late)
remembering the memories(the green lights come on)
Ain't nothing like the first time (I gotta have your ass home)
or how things used to be Ok, come travel with me down memory lane
Back in my wonder years when nobody considered me sane
First time I got a whooping 'sRight where I begin
Cuz what I did I told my mom I'd never do it again
Round four years old and young Luda's a menace (yep)
But I cried the first time I had to go to the dentist
Cuz I was scared then a mug, I couldn't stand no doctors
But I loved getting drunk my first time off vodka (oh yeah)
'Til the very next morning I was hung on over (uh huh)
Proceeded to throw upon my grandma's sofa
It was nasty swore I wouldn't take another sip
The first time getting high I had to take another hit
It wasn't working at first then I started tweaking
Back seat of my boy's ride just laughing for no reason
Been rappin' since I was seve, I remember the time
Plus I wrote my first son when I was nine
And ain't nothing like the first time Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be Oh, yo  gotta go, yo  gotta get yo r ass out
Cuz im my momma come home, well she's likely to pass out man
That's what I said about my bust my first nuts
Cuz all through grade school we tried to bust the first slut
That we could geto our hands on, sex never last long
After sixty seconds tell that trick to put her pants on
It smell like badussy, and I don't like that
I'm about to call her four eyes and I'll be right back Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be I got memories in the corner of my mind
Misty watered colored memories, thinking bout the first time
That I learned how to ride my bike
And the first time I got into a fight
Or it could have been the first time
I got my heart broke by this girl I like
My first time to Atlanta was my first time on a plane
My first time on ecstacy I stood out in the rain
My first time getting grain I was in the backseat of Rudy car
The first time I stole was a sky box, basketball cards, and a candy bar
The first time I heard the legend, we robbed the dope boy
We got about thirty grand out
I was fifteen years old and in high school
And I had to tall Willy every look stand out
First everything, home brewing, bitch swing
Like Micheal when he won his first championship ring
And he cried with the troph   that's like my first rhyme
First check for rapping on back for the first time
First met Quincy Jones, he said I looked like Snoop
I remember when me and Chris were in a group Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be And I had to tell Willy every look stand out
