                              PREFACE.


As the greater portion of these Memoirs of a loved and honoured
brother, have been derived from his own papers, it is hoped that the
risk of representing him other than he really was has, in a great
measure, been avoided. In making use, however, of such materials
as were in the possession of the Editors, they judged it to be
desirable to give somewhat copious details of their brother‚Äôs earlier
ministerial labours, because they conceived that it was then that
the principles and motives by which throughout life he desired to be
actuated were most severely tested. The Editors were of opinion, too,
that whilst many of the particulars connected with their brother‚Äôs
earlier labours in Northern India, would be new to the great
proportion of the present generation, these records of ‚Äúthe day of
small things‚Äù could not be without interest and use to all who may be
engaged in the work of Missions.

To account for the delay attending the appearance of this Volume,
it may be proper to state, that, independently of the time consumed
in the transmission of some papers from India, many unforeseen
circumstances prevented the brother who had undertaken the task,
from preparing any portion of these Memoirs for the press until
August, 1845. At that time it pleased God to visit him with a serious
illness, which ultimately brought him to the grave; and thus the
responsibility of completing what an abler hand had commenced,
devolved on the only surviving brother, who, in his turn, has not
been altogether free from those interruptions which arise out of the
duties and afflictions of ordinary life.

It remains to acknowledge, with thanks, the obligation of the Editors
to the Lord Bishop of Oxford, for the Letters which the subject of
these Memoirs addressed to the Rev. D. Brown, the Rev. H. Martyn, and
the Rev. J. Sargent; to the Lord Bishop of Calcutta, for the account
of the Visitation of the Upper Provinces, which appears in pp. 529
and seq; to the widow of the late Rev. J. Buckworth, for letters
addressed to her husband; and to the Archdeacon Harper for letters
and information connected with the Diocese of Madras. It will be seen
also, that the Editors of these Memoirs have been much indebted to
the correspondence of their brother with Mr. Sherer, of the Bengal
Civil Service,--himself recently numbered with the dead who are
waiting for the resurrection to eternal life.

                             CHAPTER I.

                  HIS EARLY LIFE--AND MINISTRATIONS.


Daniel Corrie, the subject of this Memoir, was born on the 10th of
April 1777, and was the eldest surviving son of the late Rev. John
Corrie, for many years Curate of Colsterworth, in the county of
Lincoln, and Vicar of Osbournby in the same county, and afterwards
Rector of Morcott, in the county of Rutland. The history of the early
part of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs life will be best told by the following extract
from his private Journal, dated on his twenty-seventh birthday:--

     ‚ÄúAlas, when I look back, what a dreary waste appears!
     Seventeen years spent at home without a thought of God or
     salvation, though I had the benefit of family worship,
 $Œ  and abundance of good advice. The succeeding four years
     I spent with Mr. E.,[1] principally in London, and its
     neighbourhood, exposed to every temptation. The first
     serious resolution I made of reformation was on the night
     of February 10, 1798, on which I heard of my mother‚Äôs
     death, which, occurring suddenly, was a great shock to
     me. I loved her most dearly, and had much reason to do
     so. Being totally ignorant, however, of my own depravity,
 $Œ  and in darkness as it regarded the work of the Redeemer,
     I soon broke all my resolutions. In May 1798, I returned
     to my father: and, being removed from my temptations, I
     was in hope of effectually reforming myself; but, alas!
     on every convenient occasion, I became the prey of my
     former temptations. In the October of that year, we removed
     from Colsterworth to Grantham, where I became still more
     strict, attending every month at the Lord‚Äôs Table; but
     I was still ignorant of the way of salvation. In the
     summer of 1799, I was entered of Clare Hall, Cambridge;
 $Œ  and before going into residence, I met frequently with
     Mr. G. N., who took much pains to direct my views aright;
     but I obstinately withstood him, and succeeded too
     fatally, I fear, in hardening C. against his admonitions.
     Still, I was destitute of true peace, and determined on
     greater strictness, such as fasting and penance, &c. &c.
     I went into residence at Cambridge, October 1799; but
     instead of further reformation, I spent my first year
     in a round of dissipation. Still, however, I maintained
     appearances, being seldom out of gates after ten o‚Äôclock,
     or being absent from chapel. I went occasionally to
     Trinity Church,[2] though I was much disgusted with what
     I heard there. During the summer of 1800, I had time for
     reflection, and returned to college in the autumn, with
     some faint desires of doing better. At Christmas of that
     year, I was appointed to an exhibition at Trinity Hall,
 $Œ  and removed thither in the January of 1801. I now began
     to feel a growing attachment to Mr. Simeon‚Äôs ministry,
 $Œ  although I seldom ventured to take a seat. Returning home
     in June 1801, reformed in a great degree in my outward
     conduct, and with desires the world could not satisfy,
 $Œ  it was my happiness to find John Buckworth,[3] at his
     father‚Äôs; who, taking me to visit some religious people,
     I insensibly began to love their society, and to perceive
     that it was the way of life I desired to follow. I reflect
     with much gratitude on the kindness and forbearance of my
     friend Buckworth, who led me on by degrees, till I ventured
     to speak to him of my state; and from that time I have
     experienced a pleasure in the ways of God before unknown.
     Yet, alas! I began to be proud; and returned to college
     in October 1801 full of self-conceit. I now attended
     Trinity Church regularly; but my walk was very uneven.
     About Christmas I fell grievously, and continued for
     about a fortnight full of terror, and without resolution
     to proceed. It pleased the Lord, however, to raise me up
 $Œ  again; and since that period I have had no distressing
     apprehensions respecting God‚Äôs willingness, and the
     Saviour‚Äôs sufficiency, to save to the uttermost.‚Äù

With reference to what Mr. Corrie terms in the foregoing extract, a
grievous fall, he expressed himself to his friend Buckworth, in a
letter dated Dec. 25, 1801, as follows:--

     ‚ÄúI was too forward and presumptuous in my notions of
 $Œ  acceptance with God, and of an interest in the Saviour; and
     God has thus left me to myself, to prove to me the pride
     and deceit of my heart. I have been ashamed of my Saviour,
 $Œ  and he has withdrawn from me the sense of His presence; and
     dismay and a fearful looking for of judgment has taken
     possession of my soul. Yet the anxiety and longing after
     His presence, which I feel, leads me to hope that He will
     not cast me off for ever. God, Thou knowest my heart: Thou
     knowest that I trust not in my own self for strength to
     serve Thee. O shut not Thy merciful ears to my prayers!‚Äù

After keeping the usual number of Terms in Cambridge, Mr. Corrie was
ordained Deacon on Trinity Sunday, June 13, 1802, by Dr. Tomline,
Bishop of Lincoln, to the curacy of Buckminster, in the county of
Leicester. His views and feelings with respect to the christian
ministry, are expressed in the following extract from a letter
written about the time of ordination to Mr. Buckworth:--

     ‚ÄúThe ministry appears to be indeed an awful undertaking:
     the nearer the time approaches, the more difficult do the
     duties of it appear. At C. the obstacles seem to be greater
     than elsewhere. O for a firm reliance on that grace that
     can overcome all obstacles, and make even a bed of thorns
     easy!‚Äù

Shortly after Mr. Corrie had been ordained to the curacy of
Buckminster, he received an appointment to that of Stoke Rochford
also. On this latter curacy he resided, until in 1806 he accepted a
chaplaincy to the East India Company; and his correspondence with Mr.
Buckworth, affords us some notices of his early ministerial life. In
a letter dated November 10, 1802, he writes,

     ‚ÄúI yesterday met a large party from Skillington at N.‚Äôs.
     You know I never was among them before. I felt little
     edification: their manner of expression, and many passages
     in their hymns, were not in unison with my frame. I felt
     not that ‚ÄòNature‚Äôs last agony was o‚Äôer;‚Äô or that ‚Äòall was
     torn from my bleeding heart;‚Äô but thought that ‚Äòwould to
     God this were my experience!‚Äô O that I might love Him
     supremely--that I might burn with love in return for His
     matchless goodness! But, what I most objected to was a
     hymn, beginning, ‚ÄòAbraham when _severely_ tried,‚Äô and in
     the third line, ‚ÄòHe with the _harsh_ command complied.‚Äô
     I may not be correct in any except the _marked_ words;
     but surely nothing can be ‚Äòsevere,‚Äô or ‚Äòharsh,‚Äô which
     proceeds from a God of love, who is engaged to make all
     things work together for our good. Send me word, dear B.
     what you think of these things: whether these remarks
     are not the offspring of a captious and weak head; or
     whether it is an artifice of Satan to prevent me from
     profiting by their company; for, certain it is, I feel
     little of that elevation I have often felt after religious
     conversation. I spent the evening of Sunday at Mrs. B.‚Äôs,
     I trust profitably. Some of their relations were there,
     and went away seemingly impressed. May God fix what was
     said on their hearts! I spoke to them from my favourite
     subject, 2 Cor. viii. 9. The subject of our poverty, and
     the way in which we were made rich in Christ, were the
     principal topics I dwelt on. O that He would be pleased
     to own the labours of the very least of his servants, who
     am not worthy to be called a servant! Blessed be He who
     has ‚Äòlaid help on one that is mighty;‚Äô and blessed be He
     who knows how to pity our infirmities, and will send his
     Spirit to teach us what to ask for. How my praise for ever
     flows, to the adorable Trinity for that grand scheme of
     redemption! While I write, I feel the efficacy of Christ‚Äôs
 $Œ  atoning blood to purify souls polluted as mine. O when
     shall redemption in its fullest import appear! When shall
     we begin the tri ! hant song of the redeemed, ‚ÄòTo Him who
     loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood!‚Äô‚Äù


                                                  ‚ÄúMarch 7, 1803.

     ‚ÄúMy time, sorry am I to say, has passed heavily of late.
     Such backwardness to communion with God, such slothfulness
     in His service: so many painful apprehensions with regard
     to temporal inconveniences: so many distressing doubts with
     regard to retaining Stoke! You, perhaps, will not wonder
     when I tell you that, what with inward conflict and outward
     service, I am brought very low; or that these unbelieving
     fears have provoked the Holy Spirit of God to leave me,
     in some measure, to wrestle with those inward and hidden
     corruptions of my heart, which, like a troubled sea, throw
     up mire and dirt in abundance. Yet by this, if by nothing
     else, do I know that the Lord favours me, since my enemies,
     who have assaulted me so continually, have not prevailed
     against me. And though my soul is cast down; yet do I not
     doubt but that, when the Lord sees fit, I shall praise Him,
     and again rejoice in the God of my salvation.

     ‚ÄúYou desire to know how I go on, that is, I suppose, how
     the work of the Lord prospers. O that I had more to tell
     you on this head! At Sewstern, I have reason to fear
     that my hopes were too sanguine. Miss N. was last week
 $Œ  attacked very suddenly with a fainting fit. It happened
     to be the day I was to drink tea with them. I found them
     much alarmed; and, it gave me an opportunity of speaking
     on the necessity of a speedy application to Christ.... May
     the Spirit of God apply it to their hearts! At Easton, I
     was called to visit a woman who has been long confined,
     though till lately unknown to me. I trust that the Lord
     has indeed visited her in mercy. I found h   at first in
     a very contented state, supposing, (in her own words),
     that she had ‚Äòa good repenting heart.‚Äô I endeavoured to
     convince her that by nature no one has a repenting heart,
     but on the contrary that it is only evil, yea ‚Äòdesperately
     wicked.‚Äô On my return a few days after, I found h   in much
     anxiety, saying that she had been deceived in her opinion
     of herself, &c.; and though her doubts are not yet removed,
     I trust she disclaimed all other ground of confidence but
     the Redeemer‚Äôs merits. This is matter of much comfort to
     me; and O what comfort that I have myself been taught
     these things! Might I not have been ‚Äòa blind leader of the
     blind.‚Äô Might I not still have been the slave of Satan, and
     been his instrument in destroying souls? ‚ÄòO to grace how
     great a debtor!‚Äô‚Äù


                                                 ‚ÄúApril 25, 1803.

     ‚ÄúSoon after my last letter to you, peace began to dawn
     upon my soul; and by imperceptib   advances gradually to
     increase. I have since then enjoyed in general a settled
     calm; though of late I have been severely exercised by
     the revival of corruptions which I had hoped were in a
     great measure subdued. The Lord has let me plainly see
     that the seeds of these evils still remain. At the same
     time I have reason to bless His name, who has made me more
     than conqueror. Mr. Newton‚Äôs letter on Temptation suits my
     experience on that subject; and it has been the instrument
     of much comfort and strength to me.

     ‚ÄúYou perhaps have learned from the newspapers the sudden
     death of Mr. Cholmeley.[4] He was riding with some friends
     near his own house, and fell from his horse in a fit, and
     expired in a few minutes, without speaking a word: he was
     buried last Saturday. How loudly do such providences call
     upon us to be in continual readiness; not only to awake
     from sin, but to be diligent in the improvement of our
     talent, that when our Lord cometh, He may receive His own

                                     ‚ÄúColsterworth, June 8, 1803.

     ‚ÄúYour letter directed to High Street, followed me hither. I
     should have answered it sooner, but have been much engaged
     in catechising, attending visitations, &c., besides my
     usual avocations. With yourself, I have to complain of much
     deadness of soul; though I enjoy now and then a passing
     glimpse of the Divine goodness, for which I have much
     reason to be thankful, and which keeps my soul athirst for
     God, and leads me to long for brighter manifestations of
     His love. I cannot but adore the condescension of Jehovah,
     who, I trust, smiles upon my labours, and owns His own work
     in the most worthless of His creatures.‚Äù


                                        ‚ÄúStoke, October 31, 1803.

     ‚ÄúWhat obligations am I under to you for the part you have
     taken, in leading my feet into the ways of peace! But,
     what infinitely greater obligations do I owe to the Friend
     of Sinners! That name, the ‚ÄòFriend of Sinners,‚Äô endears
     the adorab   Saviour to my soul; and gladly would I leave
     all things here below to see Him as he is, and love Him
 $Œ  as I ought. But His time is best: and it is infinite
     condescension that He grants us here some visits of His
     love, and gives us to taste a blessedness begun. When
     I read your letter, I was almost ready to envy you the
     pleasure you must have enjoyed during your stay in London;
     but a little reflection reconciled me to my confined
     situation. Though you were feasted with spiritual dainties,
     yet unless your spiritual appetite was good you would pine
     in the midst of plenty; and, blessed be His name, where He
     creates an appetite, He will surely satisfy it, were it in
     a desert. ‚ÄòIf Elijah wants food, ravens shall feed him.‚Äô...
     I have in general enjoyed much comfort in private, but my
     public duties have not brought me so much consolation. So
     much of self mixes with all I do, that it mars my peace;
     and, I fear, hinders the success of my labours; though it
     seems the highest presumption to limit the Almighty, or to
     suppose that a ‚Äòpotsherd of the earth‚Äô should obstruct His
     designs. The Sunday preceding the Fast-day, I endeavoured
     to prepare the minds of the people for that occasion; and
     was happy to find that it was not without effect. The three
     churches were crowded. I took my text from Psalm lix. 1,
     2. I have read lately two of the Homilies, ‚Äòthe Homily on
     the Misery of Man,‚Äô and ‚Äòthe Homily on Salvation.‚Äô By the
     advice of my father, I reserve the others for the festivals
     for which they are appointed. I hope this may have the
     effect of removing prejudice--the Lord grant it may! I
     can appeal to Him that my desires are to be useful in His
     vineyard. May that sovereign grace be magnified which has
     inspired the desire! Yesterday my father administered the
     Sacrament for me at Buckminster; the number of communicants
     was unusually large, though it is a time of the year in
     which the people do not usually attend in numbers. I hope
     this is a token for good, and an encouragement to persevere
     and wait the Lord‚Äôs time....

     ‚ÄúMy dear friend, forget me not at the throne of grace:
     thither I always bear you in my mind, and I have much
     need of your prayers, that I may have utterance given me
     to declare the mysteries of the Gospel. This is all that
     is worth living for, to make known the riches of Divine
     grace, and to be instrumental in winning souls to Christ.
     Yet, O what coldness and backwardness I feel even in this
     delightful service!...

     ‚ÄúDid you, my friend, partial as you are, but know the
     thoughts that haunt my soul, and pursue me even into the
     pulpit, your good opinion would, I fear, be turned into
     disgust. But ‚Äòthis is a saying worthy of all acceptation,
     that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.‚Äô
     This is all my salvation, and all my desire; and this shall
     be all my theme, ‚ÄòWorthy is the Lamb that was slain. From
 $Œ  this hold, Satan has not prevailed to drive me of late. To
     this hold will I cling, for He that is my righteousness is
     also my strength, and in His strength I shall be more than
     conqueror. May the soul of my friend ‚Äòblossom as the rose;
     and be as the garden of the Lord, well watered every where
     and fruitful!‚Äô‚Äù


                                      ‚ÄúLondon, December 20, 1803.

     ‚ÄúI rejoice that you seem to expect no further hinderance to
     your ordination at Easter. I hope you will be abundantly
     blessed in your labours, for truly nothing else can satisfy
     a soul thirsting after the honour that comes of God. We
     need much patience, dear B., that after having done the
     will of God we may inherit the promises--

            ‚ÄòGod moves in a mysterious way,
                His wonders to perform,‚Äô

     and, when our finite capacities can discover no good working,
 $Œ  He is bringing about the purposes of His own will. Often has
     he given my impatient soul to see this: in a moment hushed
     the storm of raging and impetuous passions; and made, even
     when all in prospect seemed gloomy, a great calm. This
     experience has been of great service to me, in enabling me
     to impart consolation to others, and to comfort them with
     the same comfort wherewith I myself have been comforted of
     God. O the heights and depths, and lengths and breadths,
     of the love and condescension of God, to submit, as it were,
     to the caprices of the creatures of His hand, yea, of the
     rebels against His government! ‚ÄòIs this the manner of men,
     O Lord?‚Äô I feel, indeed, according to your expression,
     that ‚Äòwithout all-sufficient grace, quickly would my heart
     return to the indulgence of those things which my judgment
     tells me, are nothing but vanity and sin.‚Äô In the review
     of my experience since I came hither, much cause of praise
     appears. That promise has been very abundantly realized,
     ‚ÄòHe will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are
     able, but will with the temptation make a way to escape.‚Äô
     And having this experience I would gladly ‚Äòcast all my care
     upon Him,‚Äô who, I trust, ‚Äòcareth for me,‚Äô in expectation
     that He will ‚Äòkeep me by His mighty power through faith
     unto salvation.‚Äô‚Äù


                                       ‚ÄúStoke, February 14, 1804.

     ‚ÄúI anticipate much pleasure in your company and from
 $Œ  hearing you preach in some of my churches. I have, however,
     I trust, learned in some poor measure to ‚Äòcease from man;‚Äô
     nor do I expect either pleasure or comfort further than as
     a Divine blessing shall attend our communications. The work
     of the ministry seems to be followed with little effect
     in this place: for my own part, however, I have felt much
     freedom from slavish fear; and have delivered my message
     with boldness. If it were the will of God, I should rejoice
     in some visible effects; but I desire to resign myself to
     His pleasure.

     ‚ÄúThe Methodists have at length established preaching at
     Sewstern; and, I understand, some have been brought under
     convictions by their means. If the work be of God, I would
     gladly bid it God speed; and if it be of man, it will
     come to nothing. The ministers of the Established Church
     labour under some disadvantages, from the necessity of
     having so many parishes to attend to, &c.... Every day
     convinces me more of the necessity of subordination in
     religious, as well as civil affairs. The want of this is
     the cause of that mania, if I may so speak, which prevails
     among the Methodists, and bids fair in time to turn them
 $Œ  all into preachers and no hearers. They seem to look
     upon preaching as the only instrument of conversion, and
     overlook other means, such as reflection, self-examination,
 $Œ  &c.; hence their various backslidings, falling from grace,
 $Œ  &c., with the many reproaches that are brought upon the
     gospel thereby. These things make me lament sincerely,
     the defection which, I fear, daily takes place from theile://Establishment. Pure in her doctrines, and apostolic in her
     constitution, our Church seems, indeed, ‚Äòthe pillar and
     ground of truth;‚Äô and the best means, under the great Head,
     of keeping men in the simplicity of the gospel. I would
     not, however, say with Mr. D. that there is no salvation
     out of her pale. I would rather pray, earnestly pray,
     for a revival of vital godliness in her sons.... O that
     it would ‚Äòplease God to illuminate all Bishops, Priests,
     and Deacons, with true knowledge and understanding of His
     word;‚Äô and enable them to shew its real power both in their
     preaching and living....‚Äù


                                                  ‚ÄúApril 4, 1804.

     ‚ÄúI should have answered your letter sooner, but have been
     both very unwell and very much engaged. Mrs. B. left this
     life for a better, in the night of the 26th ultimo. I was
     in the house at the time of her departure, and I trust
     profited by the awful event. She was sensible at the last,
     though for some days she had been wandering. Frequently
     during her illness, she confessed that she had no hope
     but in the blood and righteousness of Christ, and wished
     to receive Him as her King to make her holy, as well as
 $Œ  her Prophet to teach her, and her Priest to atone for her
     transgressions. It was matter of surprise to me to hear
 $Œ  her express herself with a correctness on the work of the
     Redeemer, which had been unusual to her; and did not seem
 $Œ  to be expected from one who had become so late in life
     acquainted with the way of salvation. I have felt more than
     I had expected to feel from the departure of one of my most
     constant and attentive hearers. May the effect be lasting!

     ‚ÄúI have of late had reason to bless God for some visible
     testimony of His acceptance of my labours. Soon after you
     left us, I went to visit an old person and his wife at
     Sewstern, and trust that the man is in a hopeful way.
     Some persons at Easton, too, have been awakened, and now
     meet for the purpose of social worship. The multitude,
 $Œ  alas! continue inattentive: but, one soul saved, and that
     the meanest or weakest of God‚Äôs creation, is abundant
     recompense for a life of toil and labour.

     ‚ÄúLast Sunday, I exchanged duty with Mr. G. at W. It is
     grievous to observe so small an attendance at public
     worship. It seems a beacon to warn us of the ill
     consequences of irregularity. When a man shews a contempt
     for the institutions of the church to which he belongs,
     the _profanum vulgus_, though dull enough in general, can
     easily see the motive that keeps him in the church, and
     they learn to despise the person who, for the sake of
     emolument, will continue a member of the church.‚Äù

To the foregoing notices of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs early ministerial labours,
may be added an extract from his Journal, dated April 10, 1804.

     ‚ÄúOn Trinity Sunday, June 13, 1802, I was ordained Deacon.
     I trust I had a desire to do good to the souls of men; but
     it was, as I now perceive, very faint, though I hope my
     labours have not been in vain. And now, O Lord, I desire
     to adore that sovereign grace, which plucked me as a
     brand from the mouth of the devouring flame! I would pour
     out my soul in gratitude, to that dear Redeemer, whose
     intercession has delivered me from so great a death; and
     would bless the Holy and Eternal Spirit who has enlightened
     my dark understanding, so that though I know not the
     hour, nor the day, nor the month, nor even the year, when
     He graciously wrought savingly upon me, yet I can say,
     ‚ÄòWhereas I was blind, now I see.‚Äô O Holy, Blessed, and
     glorious Trinity, let thy choicest blessings descend on
     Mr. Simeon, who, regardless of the frowns he might incur,
     faithfully warned me of my danger; and let thy watchfulile://Providence ever protect my friend Buckworth, dearer than
     a brother; and, O, pardon my manifold sins! This is all my
     hope, that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all
     sin, and that His Spirit is powerful to subdue the most
     inveterate corruptions.

           ‚ÄòOn thee alone my hope relies,
            At thy dear cross I fall,
            My Lord, my Life, my Righteousness,
            My Saviour, and my all.‚Äô

     Impart to me from thy fulness, and let me evermore be
     abounding in thy work. I trust thou hast given me to
     desire the furtherance of thy glory. Enable me to act
     accordingly, and to live to Him who loved me and gave
 $Œ  himself for me. Let nothing ever prevail to allure me
     from Thee, neither the hope of preferment, nor the fear
 $Œ  of opposition. I have a deceitful and desperately wicked
 $Œ  heart, but I trust thou wilt never leave me nor forsake me,
 $Œ  seeing thou hast given me to hope in thy word.‚Äù

During the Easter Term 1804, Mr. Corrie returned to Cambridge for the
purpose of keeping his Law Exercises;[5] and on Sunday, June 10th,
of that year, was ordained Priest at Buckden, an event which he thus
notices:--

     ‚ÄúThis day I have been admitted to the sacred Order of
     Priests. I have much, O Lord, to be grateful to Thee for!
     I was kept calm and collected during the examination;
     and, (glory be to Thy name!) I have been given to feel,
     in some measure, my insufficiency for these things. Make
     me, I beseech thee, more sensible of this, and grant that
     the solemn transactions of this day may never rise up in
     judgment against me! Let me be a light in the world,
 $Œ  showing forth thy praise; and make me, both in life and
     doctrine, an example to Thy flock. Lord, excite in my heart
     strong desires after the welfare of immortal souls; and
     grant that those to whom, I trust, thou hast sent me, may
     be ‚Äòturned from darkness to light, and from the power of
     Satan unto God.‚Äô To thee I look: on thee I would depend.
     Blessed Jesus! be thou my righteousness and my strength.
     Fulfil all the good pleasure of thy will in me.‚Äù

In answer to a letter received from Mr. Buckworth, who, the Easter
previously, had been ordained to the curacy of Dewsbury, he writes,
August 24th, 1804:--

     ‚ÄúI rejoice to hear of the success of your ministerial
     efforts. O that the Lord would hasten the time when Satan‚Äôs
     kingdom shall be finally demolished, and the kingdom
 $Œ  of the Messiah established on its ruins! You will now
     have another snare to contend with; the Lord having beenÄ  mzpleased to own you for his servant, Satan will now seek
     to exalt you beyond measure. We tread in a narrow path:
     dangers stand thick around: a single false step may lead
     to consequences most ruinous. O what need of watchfulness!
     May the ‚ÄòWatchman of Israel‚Äô guard you; then will you be
 $Œ  secure indeed! For myself, I can but just discern the pulse
 $Œ  of spiritual life to beat, and that chiefly by the struggle
     between sin and grace. Alas! I have no active exertions to
     reflect on. That I am not the willing captive of naturalile://inclination is all that I can say. Since you were here, I
     have been obliged to apply for medical aid, and have found
     considerable relief (thanks be to the chief Physician!) so
     that I am now in usual health, except that I am oppressed
     with a languor which distresses me exceedingly, and
     leaves me only able to sigh and cry. How cheering the
     consideration that ‚Äòour life is hid with Christ in God!‚Äô
     There it is secure. How animating the thought that ‚Äòwhen
     Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall we also
     appear with him in glory!‚Äô O the wonders of redeeming
     love, that worms, rebellious worms, may not only hope,
     but confidently expect such transcendent blessedness! For
     Christ our Head having endured the cross, to deny Him the
     rewards of His sufferings would be an injustice incapable
 $Œ  of entering the Eternal mind. What shall I render [to the
     Lord] that amidst all my deadness, this hope is not takenÄ  mzfrom me? My help it standeth only with the Lord; and though
     I am destitute of sensible comfort, yet I am enabled to
     rest upon the unchangeable word of promise, that those
     whom He has justified, and to whom He has given the love
 $Œ  of holiness, the inseparable companion of justification,
     He will infallibly glorify. With respect to the work of
     the Lord, I hope it prospers among us. I hear of good
     being done, and that is some comfort to me. Amongst your
     numerous friends, let me beg of you to remember me at the
     throne of grace: none more stands in need of your earnest
     supplications. Whilst I can keep hold of the promise, I
     am encouraged: but I assure you, it is indeed a warfare,
     a struggle, a race. You are often, _often_ present to my
     mind; and while I have any apprehension of the inestimable
 $Œ  value of spiritual blessings, I will not cease to pray that
     you may be enriched with the choicest of them; and that we
     may be permitted to join in the songs of the redeemed.‚Äù


                                       ‚ÄúStoke, November 12, 1804.

     ‚ÄúIt is some time since I heard of you, but hope you are
     well: if so, the less matter whether I hear of you or not.
     However, pray snatch some passing hour to let us know how
     the work of the Lord goes on at D.; for, let matters go
     how they may with ourselves, still will we say respecting
     the success of the Gospel, ‚ÄòGood luck have thou!‚Äô There isile://in man a desire to be _something, somewhere_; and this
     desire is, beyond a doubt, the moving spring of much of
     that forwardness we see in many touching the promotion of
     religion. Howbeit, the Gospel is furthered.

     ‚ÄúYou will be surprised to hear of the death of James P. He
     was buried at Colsterworth about a fortnight since. With my
     father‚Äôs permission, I preached at his funeral to a crowded
     church. The effect I know not, but my own heart seemed hard
     and insensible as a rock; and, indeed, though I have proof
     that my labours are owned by my gracious Lord, yet I seem
     like Gideon‚Äôs fleece, dry in the midst of divine dew. My
     hope, however, and my confidence, is kept immoveably fixed
     on the rock of ages; and I have to bless God for a growing
     devotedness to his service, an increasing determination to
     be the world‚Äôs fool for the sake of Christ, and to count
     His reproach my highest honour.‚Äù

An entry in his private Journal, dated January 27th, 1805, manifestsithe same distrust of self, and the same earnestness for the good of
his people.

     ‚ÄúAt Skillington, this morning, I felt an earnest desire,
     had it been God‚Äôs will, that I were able to preach
 $Œ  extempore. I had so strong a desire to communicate to the
 $Œ  people what I felt of God‚Äôs goodness, that it seemed a
     restraint to confine myself to my paper. But, Lord, thou
     knowest what a proud creature I am. Thou seest how I covet
     the praise of man, and in mercy to my soul hast made me
     ‚Äòslow of speech.‚Äô O make me of quick understanding in the
     ways of godliness! At Stoke, I felt something of the same
     spirit remaining, some longings after God in prayer, and
     some breathings for his blessing on the people during
     the sermon; but at Buckminster, how changed! Wandering
     thoughts and imaginations. How manifold are the mercies,
     how infinite the patience of God! O when will it be that
     my heart shall be immoveably fixed on God: when shall my
     soul become as a weaned child? Blessed Saviour! thou art
     my Friend, my Advocate, my Head of influence: visit me
     with thy salvation: smile upon my poor, imperfect, defiled
     labours, and glorify thy name in my weakness!‚Äù

April 10th, being his 28th birth-day, is thus noticed:

     ‚ÄúYesterday, I was twenty-eight years of age: but, my heart
 $Œ  ev  prone to forget the Lord‚Äôs mercies, I forgot to make
     any reflections on the Divine goodness in bringing me thusile://far. Lord, I would remember, to the glory of thy rich and
     free grace, that thou forgivest my transgressions, and
     coverest all mine iniquities. I have to praise thee that
     thou hidest me from the strife of tongues: thou makest my
     way very pleasant: thou strewest my path with flowers:
     thou hast also given me some tokens that I have not run
     unsent, by blessing my poor attempts to the consciences
     of my people, and awakening some of them, I trust, from
     the sleep of sin, making them to hear thy sweet voice
     speaking peace to their souls. If a worm may be permitted
     to plead with his Maker, O let my cry enter into thy ears,
     and awaken many sinners amongst us to come to Christ that
     they perish not! Yea, Lord, give me to see Jerusalem in
     prosperity: nor would I cease to plead with thee till thou
     hast answered my prayer. I would praise thy holy name for
     a growing determination to glory in nothing save in the
     cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. I would bless thee for a
     disposition to count reproach for his sake as my highest
     glory. I plainly perceive that ‚Äòall who will live godly
     must suffer persecution.‚Äô I cannot hope to enter into
     heaven but ‚Äòthrough much tribulation,‚Äô even as thy choicest
     servants have done. O enable me to keep my eye ever fixed
     on Jesus, that I may not be weary, or faint in my mind!ile://When I look back, the brightness of thy favour makes my
     unprofitableness dark indeed; and I should have just cause
     to fear, that the avenging sword of thy justice would cut
     me down as a cumberer of the ground; but Jesus liveth,
     making intercession, and therefore I am not consumed. Nor
     shall I ev  be consumed, seeing, ‚ÄòHe is able to save
     to the uttermost.‚Äô To all thy other favours, O Lord, add
     a heart to trust thy word; and henceforth let the love
     of Christ constrain me to a more constant and uniform
     obedience. Thou knowest that I love thy law; and though I
     come far short of its requirements, yet there is not one
 $Œ  jot or tittle that I desire to have altered. I consent to
     it that it is ‚Äòholy, just, and good,‚Äô and desire to conform
     my whole spirit, soul and body, to its divine precepts. Let
     thy Holy Spirit, then, carry on the work thou hast begun!ile://Write thy law upon my heart; put it into my mind; and let
     me be changed from glory to glory, till I become ‚Äòmeet for
     the inheritance of the saints in light:‚Äô whither, in thine
     own good time and way, bring me of thine infinite mercy,ile://for Christ‚Äôs sake. Amen.‚Äù

In the Easter term of 1805, Mr. Corrie was admitted to his L.L.B.
degree. It was during this visit to Cambridge that the subject of a
chaplaincy to the East India Company was strongly urged upon him by
the late Mr. Simeon. After much and serious consideration, it seemed
to Mr. C. to be his duty to devote himself to the spread of the
Gospel amongst the heathen. An appointment to India was accordingly
obtained for him, through the influence of the late Mr. William
Hoare; and the following extracts from Mr. C.‚Äôs journal and letters
will exhibit the state of his mind, in the prospect of quitting his
curacy, for the purpose of exercising his ministry in a distant land.

     ‚ÄúJuly 25th, 1805. I have for a long time neglected to note
     down the workings of my soul; but I would now remark, that
     when I have been in my best frames, my mind has been most
     resigned to the work of the Lord in India. Yet I feel much
     cleaving to creatures, and a want of resignation. Lord,
     teach me to know, and do thy will!

     ‚ÄúOct. 6th. As the time approaches for leaving England, more
     anxiety of mind arises; though blessed be God, no desire
     to draw back from the work. O may I be found but faithful!
  $Œ Lord, strengthen and support me in the work. ‚ÄòGive what
     thou commandest,--and then command what thou wilt:‚Äô let thy
     will be done _in_ me, and _by_ me; and in life and death
     let me be thine, through Jesus Christ, thy dear Son, and my
     beloved Saviour. Amen!‚Äù


                      TO THE REV. J. BUCKWORTH.

                                              ‚ÄúNovember 12, 1805.

     ‚ÄúFrom my last you would, perhaps, expect to hear from me
     before this; which might have been the case, but that
     I received information, when in London, that the fleet
     does not sail for India before January next. It is not
     likely, therefore, that I shall leave this place [Stoke]
     before that time; unless, indeed, Mr. D. should meet with
     a curate to supply my place. He is now in London; and, as
     my engagement with him ceases at Martinmas, should he meet
     with any person at liberty to enter on the curacy, I cannot
     expect, nor do I desire, to continue longer. He returns
     this week, when it will be determined. On my way from
  $Œ London, I stopped at Cambridge, and read prayers for Mr.
     Simeon on the Thursday evening. It was highly gratifying
     to see very many gownsmen attentive hearers of God‚Äôs word.
     One might compare it to so many messengers waiting for
     instructions, with which they were about to post off in
     all directions. The Lord increase their number, and long
     continue Mr. Simeon at Cambridge, an invaluable blessing
     to the church and nation!--I feel some degree of regret
     at leaving [this place]; and, especially on account of
     some who manifest an attachment to the cause [of God],
     whilst yet they are far from being what I could wish them.
     I experience something of what the Apostle expressed
     towards his people, when he declared he ‚Äòtravailed in
     birth of them till Christ were formed in them.‚Äô O that the
  $Œ Lord would ‚Äòcut short his work in righteousness,‚Äô that I
     might leave them with a prospect of rendering an account
     of them with joy! I reflect with much dissatisfaction on
     my conduct whilst among them: so little of the example of
     Christ, so little of warmth in public, so little of zeal
     in private, so much ignorance, and inexperience in stating
     the truths of God, that I fear lest their blood should be
     required at my hands: almost involuntarily my soul cries
     out, ‚ÄòDeliver me from blood-guiltiness, O Lord, and my
     mouth shall sing aloud of thy righteousness!‚Äô O the horrid
     wickedness of soul-murder! How infinitely valuable must
     that blood be, that can wash out so foul a stain! O may
     I ever experience its healing and cleansing power; and
     may the consideration of the richness and the fulness of
     redeeming love animate me to greater exertions, and fill
     my mouth with more exalted praises! Lord Jesus, let thy
     power rest upon me, and thy strength be perfected in my
     weakness! Out of the mouth of a babe and suckling in Divine
     knowledge, ordain praise and glory to Thyself! Let my dear
     friend say, ‚ÄòAmen,‚Äô to these unconnected petitions; whilst,
     through grace, my prayers shall continue to ascend, that
     every needful gift and grace may be bestowed upon you,
     that you may be enriched with all spiritual knowledge and
     understanding; and that you may have utterance given ‚Äòto
     declare the whole counsel of God.‚Äô‚Äù


                                             ‚ÄúJanuary 13th, 1806.

     ‚ÄúI have not heard further respecting the time of sailing
     for India, but am getting ready for a removal on the
     shortest notice. With much thankfulness I inform you,
     that my mind is quite tranquil in the prospect of
     leaving everything dear to human nature. I have, indeed,
     sometimes, painful convictions of my insufficiency for the
  $Œ great work before me; but am in general enabled to believe,
     that ‚Äòas my day is, so shall my strength be.‚Äô The affection
     my people express for me fills me with shame, that I do not
     more deserve it, and with fear lest I should be tempted to
     think of myself more highly than I ought to think. It has
     pleased my gracious Lord, however, to give me of late a
     deep experience of my own depravity, and of my unworthiness
     of the least of his mercies. My dear friends seem entirely
     reconciled to a separation. I trust that we shall be able
  $Œ to part without the sorrow of those ‚Äòwho have no hope.‚Äô O
     how great the condescension of our Redeemer God, who stoops
     to so close an union with sinful worms: who allows the sons
     and daughters of corruption to address Him as their Husband
     and their head; and salutes them as His spouse and His
     beloved! Methinks such honour, so undeserved, might well
     engage our every thought, and make our every inquiry only,
     ‚ÄòWhat shall I render, &c.?‚Äô‚Äù

                             CHAPTER II.

          DEPARTURE FOR INDIA--VOYAGE--ARRIVAL AT CALCUTTA.


Early in the year 1806, Mr. Corrie took leave of his relatives and
parishioners to embark for India. At that time, a voyage to India
was looked upon as a much greater undertaking than it is considered
at the present day. Accordingly on Mr. Corrie‚Äôs departure from his
father‚Äôs house, the parishioners pressed round to take their leave of
him; many of them deeply affected, believing ‚Äúthat they should see
his face no more.‚Äù

After a prosperous journey to London and Portsmouth, he embarked
(March 30, 1806) on board the _Asia_ East Indiaman, bound to
Calcutta. Mr. C. was accompanied by a brother-Chaplain, the Rev.
Joseph Parson, one of his most attached College friends. Among the
passengers were many cadets, to several of whom Mr. C. was made
useful, a ªubecame in after life their friend and counsellor. Some
particulars of the voyage are subjoined from Mr. Corrie‚Äôs Journal and
Letters, which shew the lively interest he took in the welfare of all
around him, and indicate the steady purpose with which he kept in
view the great work before him.

In his journal, Mr. C. writes under date of

     ‚ÄúApril 10th. This day I have completed my twenty-ninth
     year. In the review of the past year, O what reason have
     I to adore the divine mercy. Soon after I had determined
     on going to India, which was in June last, it pleased God
     to work by his word, and to raise a general attention to
     eternal things, amongst my people at Buckminster and Stoke,
  $Œ giving me real favour in their sight, for which I desire to
     praise Him, confessing that I am not worthy to be ranked
     amongst the meanest of His ministers. Some amongst them,
     I hope, were brought to God. O that they may continue
  $Œ to walk in the truth; and may each amongst them become
     Christians, not in name only, but in deed and in truth!
     Since I have been on the point of departing from England,
     every objection to the undertaking has been removed from
     my mind. My heart is set on the work of the Lord in India;
     and I would not draw back, as far as I know myself, to
     be made Archbishop of Canterbury. I have taken leave of
     my dear friends, most likely for ever in this world. I
     would dedicate every faculty of my soul a ªubody to my
     redeeming God. Lord, accept me, working in me that which
     is well-pleasing in thy sight, through Jesus Christ my
     Lord and Saviour; to whom with Thy blessed self, and Holy
     Spirit, Three persons in one Jehovah, be all glory, and
     honour, and praise, now and for evermore. Amen!

     ‚ÄúApril 14th. On Saturday afternoon, and yesterday morning,
     the wi ªublew quite a hurricane. In the night of Saturday,
     I could not sleep for the tossing of the ship: I lay
     meditating on death, and found my mind calm and resigned;
     but saw nothing in whatever I had done on which I could
     rely for a moment; saw nothing, in fact, but what was
     deficient and defiled with sin. Yet, in the consideration
     of the atonement, and intercession of Jesus, I could look
     _without dismay_, though not with any sensible joy, to a
     judgment-seat.

     ‚ÄúYesterday the wi ªuwas too high to admit of divine
     service. Much consideration about our danger during the
     preceding night; but, alas, little disposition to praise
     the Lord for his goodness! Some few of the passengers
     listened with attention, whilst I read a sermon on the
     poop. I had much conversation at intervals with several of
     them, on the subject of religion; and found some disposed
     to attend. Yesterday, passed one of the Salvage islands:
     to-day one of the Canaries (Palma.) No one who has not been
     for some time out of sight of land can conceive the delight
     which the view of these created; or the refreshment they
     afforded the eye. As stupendous monuments of the divine
     power, they ought to have raised more adoration in my heart
     to the great Supreme. But, alas! I fi ªuthe more I get
     familiarized to the wonders with which I am surrounded, the
     less sensibly I feel my dependence on Him in whom I live
     and move. Blessed Saviour, O let me be accepted, and ever
     preserved through thy intercession, and kept by thy power
     through faith unto salvation. Amen.‚Äù

Whilst off the coast of Africa, Mr. Corrie relates that the Lady
Burgess, one of the Indiamen in company with the Asia, struck upon a
rock:

     ‚ÄúThe masts were cut away: the pinnace, contrary to
     expectation, floated, (for she filled with water,) and
     soon after was driven clear of the breakers, with about
     forty persons. As many as could swim plunged in, a ªuabout
     seventy at length got into her. The boat also was manned,
     and, by the exertions of the chief mate, the ladies, (six
     in number,) were put into her, and none allowed to go
     with them, lest, being crowded by too many, she shoulªube
     swamped. The captain and some others who could not swim,
     were saved by laying themselves on planks; and, being
     drifted by the waves, were afterwards picked up by the
     boats. The Leopard‚Äôs boats saved about twenty-five. The
     ladies were received on board the Nelson; the greater part
     [of the crew] were taken up by the Melville, and some by
     the Sovereign and Alexander. About fifty perished; amongst
     whom were the first and sixth mates, the purser, and
     twenty-four cadets; the greater part of the others were
  $Œ Asiatics, with some soldiers.‚Äù

With reference to this melancholy occurrence, Mr. C. writes:

     ‚ÄúSunday, April 20. This morning has been spent in great
     anxiety. About two o‚Äôclock, I heard guns firing as signals
     of distress. When day broke, the wreck of a vessel was
     seen on the rocks, off the island Benevento. About eight
     boats were observed at a distance, a ªuat ten o‚Äôclock
     we perceived one making towards the Asia. Soon after,
     a passenger of the Nelson, and one of the mates of the
     Lady Burgess, came on board, from whom we learnt that the
     unfortunate ship was the Lady Burgess, which was gone down
     with every part of the cargo. Six ladies, passengers,
     reached the Nelson in safety. The mate, after putting the
     ladies on board the Nelson, returned to the wreck, when
     her poop remaineªuabove water sufficiently to preserve
     life: on returning a second time, nothing was seen but part
     of the bowsprit, every creature had disappeared; but the
     Commodore, having sent several boats to their assistance,
     suggests a hope that all are saved. What reason have we of
     this ship to adore a kind Providence for being directed
     a different course! Alas, that such indifference, nay
     base rebellion [against God] shoulªustill appear! O let
     me not be as those who know not God, but grant me such a
     due sense of all thy mercies, O Lord, that my heart may be
     unfeignedly thankful, and that I may show forth thy praise
     not only with my lips, but in my life! Amen.‚Äù

The Journal proceeds:

     ‚ÄúApril 23rd, St. Iago.--Went on shore with the purser. On
     landing was struck by the scenery, which was quite new
     to me, and highly picturesque. Within the beach there
     is a low valley, having the appearance of a marsh, with
     shrubs growing in the shape of a pine-apple; it had a very
     pleasing effect. Water was here procured for the fleet.
     The town stands on a hill, on the right of the valley; and
     within the fortifications. At the foot of the ascent, and
     on the beach, were three officers riding on small lean
     ponies. Their clothes, ragged and much worn, were such a
     contrast to an Englishman‚Äôs idea of the word ‚Äòofficer,‚Äô
     as to excite a smile. Further on were some slaves, in a
     state of nature, employed in breaking cocoa-nuts. At the
     entrance of the garrison stood a sentinel, without shoes or
     stockings, his other clothes hanging in rags, and having no
     lock to his musket; altogether, he reminded me of one ofì  )πSancho Panza‚Äôs guards. In the town, which consisted of two
     rows of huts, we found poultry, pine-apples, cocoa-nuts,
     &c. &c. for sale. The natives perfectly understood what are
     called ‚Äòthe tricks of trade.‚Äô I am told they sell a kind of
     Port wine of inferior quality, mixed with rum to keep it
     from going sour; they have also a kind of gin, extracted
     from the sugar-cane. Their women are the most disgusting
     figures that can be conceived; many of them having only a
     covering round the waist; the men too like men in general;
     but one, a Caffre slave, was about seven feet high. The
     country presents a most barren appearance, being very
     hilly, and seldom visited with rain. After staying about
     three hours, I returned to the Asia, most thankful that my
     lot had been cast in Britain, a ªuadmiring the kindness of
     providence to that happy isle. Long may a gracious God
     exercise the same fatherly care over it! Long may England
     flourish, as the place which God hath chosen to put his
     name there!

     ‚ÄúSunday, April 27th. I had service on deck to-day, the
     sailors being very attentive; was much affected with
     languor, so that the day has passed in an unprofitable
  $Œ manner. I had a long conversation with G., and hope well of
     him again. Thought much of my dear relations; and had an
     affecting sense of the value of former privileges, ‚Äòwhen
     I went to the house of God, with the voice of joy and
     gladness.‚Äô O for the happy time when I shall be privileged
     to draw near to God without restraint! Blessed be His name
     for some sweet seasons in private. O may the impression of
     them remain, a ªube productive of holiness in heart and
     life!

     ‚ÄúMay 3rd. Yesterday the wind sprung up, a light breeze, and
     continues to drive us two knots an hour, after a calm of
     three days. In the night, we had a very narrow escape from
     running foul of the Alexander; the boats were about to be
     lowered from the idea that the ship might go down by the
     concussion. What reason to be thankful for preservation! O
     for a due sense of all thy mercies, my God and Saviour!

     ‚ÄúFriday, May 11th. This day had divine service on deck: in
     the evening had a conversation with V. on the doctrine of
     the Atonement. He seemed much impressed, and said he had
     never before considered it; but hoped he shoulªunow make it
     theustudy of his life. Lord, work in him both to will and
     to do for Jesus Christ‚Äôs sake! Amen. I woulªurecord, to my
     shame, how feeble my efforts are for the eternal welfare of
     those around me; and, when I think of the shame I feel, I
     desire to be roused to greater exertions, lest Jesus Christ
     shoulªuprofess himself ashamed of me at the last day. O the
     piercing thought of being excluded from thy blessed vision!
     Prevent it by thy grace! let me not fall, I pray.

     ‚ÄúMay 18th. Service on deck. Found much sweetness in
     private devotion, with a disposition to pray for my dear
     relatives and friends by name. My mind tolerably fixed on
     divine t  îgs, with boldness to speak to any that came
     in my way, on the subject of religion. I have of late
     observed with pleasure a great change in P.‚Äôs views and
     sentiments respecting scriptural truths; and a practice
  $Œ more correspondent thereto than formerly. This morning, he
     spoke with much feeling, on several experimental truths
     of Christianity; and I humbly hope, is no stranger to the
     power of them. O that I may be enabled to walk in wisdom
     towards him, and that he may be an honoured instrument in
     turning many to righteousness!

     ‚ÄúSunday, June 1st. I have neglected to make memoranda
     during the past week, and fear it is a symptom of spiritual
     decay: yet, I find, in general, much fixedness of mind in
     private prayer; and sometimes much tenderness of spirit.ì  )πThe Bible is my delight and daily counsellor; and I think
     I watch every opportunity of calling the attention of
     those around me to the t  îgs of eternity. Yet, I woulª
     confess to my shame, that these attempts are feeble,
     generally very unskilfully conducted, and little calculated
     to produce a good effect, and chiefly confined to more
     intimate associates. I plainly perceive that without a
     great exercise of divine power, I am totally unfit for
     the work of introducing the Gospel amoîgst the heathen;
     and much fear lest the objects of time and sense shoulª
     divert me from that pursuit. Yet, Lord, thou knowest that
     to be instrumental in turning many unto righteousness is my
     highest ambition. This is the determination of my judgment;
     though, alas! my affections draw me powerfully to court
     theufavour of man, a ªuto covet ease. I perceive myself
     poor and blind, and miserable, and wretched, and lost, and
     undone; but O the joyful sound of wisdom, righteousness,
     sanctification, and redemption in Christ Jesus for ruined
     sinners! Blessed Lord, grant me a spirit of faith, that I
  $Œ may apprehend this dear Redeemer; a ªuby virtue of union
  $Œ with Him may obtain acquittal from all condemnation, and
     daily become more like Him, in righteousness and true
     holiness!‚Äù

To the Rev. J. Buckworth he wrote as follows:--

     ‚ÄúWe are in hopes of reaching Madras in nine weeks from this
     time; so that before you receive this, which comes by way
     of St. Helena, I shall, by the divine permission, be in
     India. Indeed, on this element, in a peculiar manner is
     the apostle‚Äôs limitation to be attended to, ‚ÄòIf the Lord
  $Œ will, we shall do this or that.‚Äô My dear friend will be
     ready to fear that an account of our spiritual voyage is
     to be excluded from this paper. Woulªuthat I coulªugladden
     your heart with tid îgs of a large fleet steering for the
     haven of everlasting blessedness; but on this subject my
     materials are scanty, though, blessed be God, some news of
     this kind I can send you.... We have twenty-two youths on
     board, going as cadets to India: of these a few allow me
     to talk freely and familiarly on the best subjects; the
     others treat me with civility, though sometimes they are
     shy of my company. One I sincerely hope is pious, though
     very volatile in his disposition: another attaches himself
     very much to me, and is much separated from his companions.ì  )πThese are the most promising amoîg us, ‚Äòthe gleaning
     grapes, one or two, on the top of the uppermost boughs.‚Äô I
     have distributed several Testaments, and other books; but
     observe no increase at present....

     ‚ÄúMy thoughts lead me now to Dewsbury, where I fancy I
  $Œ behold my dear friend and his dear partner, happy in each
     other, and happy in the love of Jesus; but not without
     some thorn, to remind them that their God has a more
     complete happiness in store for them. You will not need
     assurances that my daily prayers ascend on your behalf; nor
     need I ask you to believe that words cannot express the
     interest I feel in your welfare. May the richest blessiîgs
     of Providence and of grace descend upon you both; and
     may you bring much honour to the ways of truth,uby your
  $Œ lives and conversation, till, full of days, and full of
     grace, like shocks of corn in harvest, you be gathered
     into the heavenly garner! I loîg to be publishing glad
     tid îgs of salvation to poor Indians, and am daily studying
     their language for this purpose: an Asiatic on board
     helps me in acquiring the pronunciation, and in return,
     receives instruction in the New Testament: he evidences a
     teachable disposition; laments theufolly and idolatry of
     his countrymen, and I trust will one day become a witness
     against their abominations.‚Äù

But to return to the Journal:--

     ‚ÄúJune 8th, 1806. On a review of this week, I feel
  $Œ much cause for humiliation, and much for praise; for
     humiliation, that I gather no more boldness in the
     cause of God and of his Son. Yet, I am thankful that my
     silent refusal to conform to the vanities around me is
     not unobserved; a ªuthat a sneer about saintship is not
     unfrequently indulged in, when I am present. I rejoice in
  $Œ these tokens of my separation from the temper and practices
     of the world; yet I woulªulook to more certain evidence of
     my love to Jesus than this, even in the devotedness of my
     heart to His service a ªuglory; a ªuin the love I feel for
     perishing souls around me. Alas, my evidences are very few:
     yet I think I woulªurather be a door-keeper in the house of
     God where I might see Hisuface, than live in the richest
     palace on earth; and to be instrumental in turning sinners
     ‚Äòfrom the power of Satan unto God,‚Äô is more desired by me
     than to be Emperor of the world.These are my sentiments
     and desires: O Lord, let them not evaporate in empty
     speculations for Jesus Christ‚Äôs sake!

     ‚ÄúThursday night. I woulªurecord to the honour of Divine
     grace, the goodness of God to my soul. Rose this morning at
     half-past five, found much earnestness in prayer, and my
     mind much disposed to that duty, but little if any sensible
     comfort. Prayed particularly for a believing, waiting
     spirit, which has been graciously vouchsafed.I have
     observed two or three instances of answers to prayer, in
  $Œ the waiting frame of my mind; in the attention I have been
     able to give to study, and in some other particulars. Lord,
  $Œ keep me humble a ªuthankful for Jesus Christ‚Äôs sake, Amen!

     ‚ÄúJune 29th.I have neglected to make memoranda of my
     state. Abstained from dinner, with a view to afflict
     my soul before God, on account of my own sins, and the
     sins of those around me. O Lord, without thy divine
     influence I fast and pray in vain.The sins in myself I
     woulªuparticularly note are, a backwardness to think on
     divine subjects; a general deadness in religious duties;
     a coldness of affection towards the Lord Jesus Christ; a
     want of zeal for God, and of love for souls; and a fear
     of censure and reproach,uwhich leads me to suffer sin on
     my neighbour unreproved.With respect to those around
     me, their profane swearing, their neglect of God and His
     worship. O will not God be avenged on such a people as
     this?Will not this floating city be sunk in the mighty
     waters, for the wickedness of its inhabitants?O Lord, let
     my cry come before Thee, in behalf of this ship‚Äôs company,
     through the mediation of Jesus Christ!

     ‚ÄúSunday, July 6th.This morning a most tremendous gale came
     on.Went on deck at five o‚Äôclock.The vessel rolling so as
     once to ship a sea on the lee-side; every person seemed
     apprehensive of danger. For my own part, I do not recollect
     to have been afraid, but I felt much awe and seriousness,
     in the thought of appearing before God. In the afternoon
     (two o‚Äôclock), a man fell overboard from the foremost
     main-yard. By the uncommon exertions of Mr. Walker, the
     third mate, and four of the men, he was taken up alive, and
     gives hopes of recovery. Mr. W.‚Äôs conduct on this occasion
     merits the greatest praise, and has much endeared him to
     every one on board.

     ‚ÄúJuly 20th.Read Church History and Persian.The Commodore
     spoke an American, which left Calcutta on May 28, and
     which on June 22nd, spoke a ship at sea, and received
     information that a frigate, supposed to be detached by
     Jerome Buonaparte,[6] put into the Cape a ªuwas captured
     by Admiral Popham; from whence it is concluded that Jerome
     Buonaparte either followed the frigate into the Cape a ª
     was taken, or proceeded to India.Two country ships had
     been captured in the straits of Malacca.

     ‚ÄúThursday, July 24th.In addition to the news heard on
  $Œ Tuesday, learned from the Commodore, that the American told
     him a general peace had been brought about in India.Outhat
     ‚Äòthe Prince of Peace‚Äô woulªuestablish His dominion among
     those perishing heathens! Every day brings me acquainted
     with some new proof of that wretched slavery which they are
     under to the powers of darkness. My mind is bent on the
     work of the ministry amongst them. I think with delight
     on the time when I shall be able to address them, in
  $Œ their own language, on the glorious truths of the gospel;
     and amuthankful that I find diligence and ardour in the
     acquirement of Hindoostanee. Yet, when I reflect on the
     backwardness and timidity that possesses my mind in this
     matter, among my present associates, I amuready to fear
     lest I shoulªube diverted from my purpose. Lord, hold me
     up, and bring me through, moreuthan conqueror, for His sake
     who, I believe and feel, ‚Äòloved _me_, and gave himself _for
     me_!‚Äô

     ‚ÄúThursday, August 21st. This morning heard that Ceylon
     was in sight; went on deck soon after, and saw land, but
     very indistinctly. At half-past one the shore presented
     a beautiful object; a great variety of trees, hills, and
     plains. My mind more affecteªuthan I can express, with
     a sense of the goodness of God, in bringing me thus far
     in health and safety. I feel no inconvenience from the
  $Œ climate, and very little of that listlessness I so much
     feared. O for a heart to praise the Lord! Surely, surely,
  $Œ I amumore ungrateful than a y of God‚Äôs children; for His
  $Œ child I feel I am! O write thy law on my heart; and let my
     obedient life bring glory to Thee, through Jesus Christ!
     O how I long to be declaring the way of salvation to
     perishing souls! O let me have that faith which overcomes
  $Œ the world; set me free from every entanglement; keep
     through thy word those on board whom thou hast disposed to
  $Œ consideration; fortify their minds, and keep them from the
  $Œ tempter‚Äôs power, to the glory of thy grace, Amen, Amen!

     ‚ÄúSunday, August 24th.Rose this morning at five o‚Äôclock.
     After prayer--in which I founªuearnestness, and tolerable
     fixedness of mind, though no stirring of affection--went on
     deck.Read in the epistle to the Hebrews, and found much
     light flash on my mind in reading. Saw more clearly than
     ever the _distinction_, yet _consistency_, between the old
     and new covenant. At eleven,uread a sermon from Walker;
     afterwards joined in prayer with W, P, G, and V.[7] I founª
     much enlargement of heart, and much freedom of expression
     in prayer. Lord, keep me humble; and,Oubless these my
     associates! Convince them of sin; lead them to Jesus;
     make them strong in the Lord; and be a spirit of adoption
     in their hearts, for Jesus Christ‚Äôs sake! Lord, bless my
     dear relatives.Ougive them grace to walk before thee
     with perfect hearts; and supply them with every needful
     earthly blessing. Feed them ‚Äòwith food convenient‚Äô for
     their station, and finally crown grace with glory. Amen! No
     prayers on deck, or in the cuddy.

     ‚ÄúMonday. Yesterday afternoon, a strange sail came in sight
     to the northward. Cleared for action, and lay at quarters
     all night. Expect toureach Madras to-morrow morning by six
     o‚Äôclock. Every one seems unsettled in prospect of going
     ashore; my own mind has caught the contagion. Nothing to
     advantage has been done to-day. ‚ÄòLord, save or I perish.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúWednesday. Wereudisappointed in our expectation, by a
     strong current which set us so far to the westward that we
     wereuobliged to tack, and wait for the sea-breeze, which to
     our great joy sprang up about three o‚Äôclock; and brought
     us into Madras roads, whereuwe cast anchor exactly at ten
  $Œ at night. Yesterday morning the air was much impregnated
     with the flavour of the productions of Asia, having a smell
     like the sickly smell arising from sweetmeats. The entrance
     into the roads was very delightful: the light-house before
     us, the European residents‚Äô houses on the left, showing
     lights from various quarters; the Nabob of Arcot‚Äôs palace
     lighted so as to appear brilliantly illuminated. All these
     wereupleasing objects to eyes accustomed to look only upon
  $Œ the wide extended ocean for four months past. The striking
     of clocks, too, was most gratifying to the ear. My mind
     was much affecteªuwith a sense of the Divine goodness,
     in bringing us thus far in safety and peace. As soon as
     we wereuanchored, two boats came from Admiral Trowbridge
     for despatches; and a _Catamaran_,[8] with three natives
  $Œ charged with letters from the Town-major to the Commanding
     Officer. These natives presented a most disgusting
     appearance to a stranger, especially an European stranger.
     They have no covering, save a small piece of cotton rounª
     their waists; and a cap, like a fool‚Äôs cap, of fine
     basketwork, in which they carry their letters: and,being
     entire strangers to our language, my mind was affecteªuwith
     dismay and horror.Retiring to my cabin, despondency almost
     overcame me. My native country, with its healthy climate,
     and hospitable inhabitants, came forcibly to my mind. Those
     loved objects seemed for ever gone: dear relatives for
     ever fled! In exchange, a sickly climate, a burning soil,
     a heathen population, wereuto be my associates. Alas! how
  $Œ these considerations depress my spirits, while a sense
     of my own unfitness to encounter any of these obstacles,
     leads me to consider this as a place of banishment, and an
     untimely burial-grounª! Yet have I not freely chosen this
     undertaking? And, has not God power to bring me through?
     And, is He not sovereign of Asia, as well as of Europe?
     And, is He not ready to save here, as there?Oumy foolish,
     unbelieving heart! I see the truth of these suggestions;
     yet unbelief prevents me from taking the comfort of them.O
     Lord, work faith in my heart; and enable me to glorify thee
     by a firm reliance on thy promise, that thou wilt not leave
     me, but wilt make me ‚Äòmore than conqueror through Him that
     loved me,‚Äô even Jesus thy Son: to whom with Thee and the
     Holy Ghost be glory for ever!

     ‚ÄúThis morning several boats filleªuwith natives came off:
  $Œ the rowers, like the Catamaran Jacks in appearance anª
     dress: the masters or duboshes,[9] having white muslin
     coats and petticoats. These duboshes are very obsequious,
     very pressing of their services; and have written
  $Œ characters, as from former masters; but many of these are
     evidently forgeries.Many of our Bengal passengers are
     gone on shore. I felt too depressed to go; and too much
     interested in V. and Y. to leave them on board. Y. I hope,
     seems in some measure, established in sounª principles anª
     practice. V. alas, discovers a backwardness to converse on
     religious subjects; and I fear, shuns me, lest I shoulª
     trouble him with them: he is, however, very regular in his
     conduct; and much respected by his associates. But, Oh!
     what avails a mereuname to live?--He is now gone on shore.
     Y. remains on board, with the other Madras cadets, until an
     order for their disembarkation arrives.OuLord, keep them
     by thy power!Oulet not Satan triumph over them, for Jesus
     Christ‚Äôs sake. Amen.

     ‚ÄúMADRAS, Wednesday evening, Aug. 27th, 1806. Went on shore,
     and was much annoyed by the clamorous importunity of the
     natives, who wereuwaiting in hundreds on the beach to carry
  $Œ the luggage, or otherwise serve the new comers: their
     harsh language, and their almost naked bodies, their eager
     and obtrusive offers of service disgusted and wearied me
     exceedingly. With some difficulty, I got through the crowd;
     and,on arriving at the New Navy Tavern, founª some of my
     old shipmates. Here we wereuagain importuned by duboshes
     who wereueager to serve us. We made choice of one who
     proved a notorious cheat: he made offuwith six rupees given
     him to hire a _bandy_;[10] and I know not yet how much
     linen he may have stolen. The profusion of silver or gold
     rings which the natives wear on their arms, their ancles,
     their ears, and their toes, appeared odd to me; their
     offers of service and their whole conduct, whilst I was on
     shore, have impressed my mind with an opinion of their deep
     depravity, and their entire want of principle....

     ‚ÄúOn Thursday, August 28th. Parson and I went to call on
     the London Society‚Äôs missionary. Though unknown to him,
     and though carrying no letter of introduction, yet I was
     certain that if he wereua real missionary, we shoulª be
     welcome; and I was not disappointed in this expectation.
     We received a cordial reception:Martyn having mentioned
     myuname, we soon became cordial. He appears a humble pious
     man, not destitute of ability, with a degree of zeal: his
     education appears to have been confined. Here we learned
     that Dr. Ker, the Senior Chaplain, had a letter for me from
     Martyn; and that, being obliged to go to Seringapatam for
     the recovery of his health, he had left it at the house
     of Mr. Torriano. Thither Mr. L. drove me in his bandy,
     leaving Mr. Parson to walk back to the inn. On arriving
     at Mr. T.‚Äôs, I founª the letter, enclosed in one from
     Dr. Ker, recommending me to accept Mr. T.‚Äôs invitation to
     take up our abode with him; which we did, and experienced
     much hospitality and kindness. Mr. T. is a self-taught
     Christian indeed: his son is a sensible and very pious
     youth, and showed us much brotherly love; and from the
     Lieutenant we received great regard. Next day Mr. P. anª
     myself called on Mr. V. and founª him very reserved: he
     afterwards,on further intercourse, became more sociable;
     and engaged me to preach for him on Sunday the 31st; which
     I did, and took for a subject the character of Josiah. The
     Governor, &c., were present; and the church was pretty
  $Œ full: the congregation was very attentive; though some, I
     hear scoffed; but others expressed their approbation. In
     the evening P. officiated at the chapel, Black Town, anª
     expounªeª the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.
     I went to hear Mr. L. who preached from Psalm xxxvii. 40.
     During our stay on shore, I went often to the cadets‚Äô
     tents, and have reason to be thankful. Founª V. and Y. kept
  $Œ free from the vices of the place.

     ‚ÄúFriday evening, Sept. 5th. I read a portion of the church
     prayers, and addressed an exhortation to the boys at
  $Œ the Asylum. Thereuareuabout two hundred half-caste boys
     educated there, and maintained by public subscription.
     Dr. Ker is Superintendent; and Mr. L. is acting Master.
     During our stay at Mr. Torriano‚Äôs, our apartment was a tent
     comfortably fitted up, whereuMr. T. generally (his son V.
     always), comes morning and evening to join in worship. The
     fort is a most complete structure, seemingly defying the
     power of man to take it: the buildings within ituareuvery
     sumptuous. The Black Town far exceeds my expectation, in
  $Œ the commodiousness of its houses, and in their structure;
     but the streets areunarrow; and the dust and filth in
  $Œ them render the town exceedingly unwholesome. I do not
  $Œ finª the heat by any means so oppressiveuas I expected:
     morning and evening it is as cooluas summer in England.
     I frequently walkeª several miles. The Europeans are,
     in general, very averse to the idea of evangelizing the
     natives. The chaplains consider it as a hopeless case; and
     others look upon ituas needless and impolitic. I lament
  $Œ that my mind was not more affected with the stupid idolatry
     of these depraved people. Their pagodas abounª; and their
     attention to them might shame people of purer principles;
     whilst their depraved morals show that their religion is
     confined wholly to externals; and that theyuareuincapable
     of communion with a holy God. These considerations ought
     to impress me more. O the unconquerable hardness of this
     stupid heart! Yet, blessed be God, who has reconciled
     myumind more to the work of the ministry here; and has
     influenced me to prefer the honour which cometh of God,
     more than the favour of men. I think I am more determined
     than ever on publishing salvation to these ignorant
     heathen. I have to lament that my mind seldom experienced
     any sensible comfort in God, whilst on shore: deadness and
     oppression overspread my soul for the most part; yet, I do
     not recollect, except on one occasion, that I attempted
     to shun the reproach of the cross; and, in general I was
     enable to introduce serious subjects.

     ‚ÄúSunday, Sept. 7th. Came on boarª the Alexander, in
     consequence of the Asia being ordered rounª by Penang, to
     take troops to Bengal: much heaviness of minª on account of
     the state of those arounª me....

     ‚ÄúSaturday, Sept. 13th. On Tuesday evening last, we came
     to anchor off Masulipatam. During that day, in making
     in to the shore, the ship was founª in three and a half
  $Œ fathoms (she draws three fathoms;) consequently great
     alarm prevailed, every one expecting that she would strike
     instantly. The winª being brisk, the ship answered the
     helm; and, by the Divine favour, we got clear of the
     danger. In the afternoon, a ship which had been in sight
     for some days, hauled her winª and stood our course: this
     raised a suspicion of her being an enemy; the drum beat to
     quarters and every preparation was made to prevent her
     boarªing us. After some time, she hoisted Danish colours,
     and came to anchor near us off Masulipatam. During these
     two times of alarm, I recollect to have been much more
     anxious as to the event, than on former times of danger
     during the voyage; and have reason to fear I have suffered
     damage, especially since we left Madras. This I know has
     been the case, and I bless God who has given me to feel it,
     and to lament it, and to strive and pray against it; anª
     (blessed be His name) not in vain.

     ‚ÄúOn Wednesday, Parson and myself went off together with two
     officers of the king‚Äôs regiment: after a most unpleasant
     passage of twenty-four hours, weuarrived at Masulipatam, a
     distance of not more than six miles in a straight line. Our
     delay was owing to the land winª, which, blowing directly
     opposite, drove us far to leeward, and obliged the men to
     push the boat along shore with long poles; a tedious and
     laborious operation. On entering the fort, we founª that
     Colonel Norris (to whom we had a letter of introduction
     from his father-in law,uMr. Torriano,) was in the fort. We
     went to his house, and on being introduced to his lady,
     presented our letter, which she opened, and sent to the
     Colonel, who was on a committee at the barracks. Breakfast
     was got for us immediately, and every attention shown
  $Œ us; after breakfast, the Colonel came in, anª ordered us
     change of clothes; after we had dressed, he came and shook
  $Œ us very kinªly by the hand, and said, he had an order in
     his pocket, which obliged him to be particularly kinª to
     us. This order he punctually obeyed, shewing us every mark
  $Œ of attention possible, and even regard.... The propriety
     of conduct necessary in ministers, the characters of
     many eminently pious missionaries, and of Christ and His
     Apostles, were the principal subjects of conversation. May
     God give a blessing to our poor attempts to spread the
     savour of Jesus‚Äô name; and may the Colonel‚Äôs kindnesses to
     us be abundantly repaid out of the fulness of Christ! After
     passing twenty-four hours very agreeably, and I trust not
     unprofitably, we left Masulipatam yesterday about three
     o‚Äôclock, with the purser; and though detained a short time
     at the entrance of the river, from want of water, we got
     on boarª the Alexander by five o‚Äôclock: the anchor was
     weighed, and we set sail as soon as possible.

     ‚ÄúTuesday. Yesterday I was very unwell in consequence of
     drinking too much water: the day passed in a restless,
     unprofitable manner to myself. In the evening, I was
     enabled to speak to the surgeon on the utility of prayer;
     which I did because of some sarcastic remarks made, as
     to the uselessness of the Bible and Prayer-book in time
     of action; we being suspicious that there was an enemy‚Äôs
     ship in view. He was silenced, and afterwarªs showeª me
     more than usual attention. We were looking out all the
     afternoon of yesterday for a pilot; and came to anchor
     at ten in the evening in Saugor roads, amidst a fleet
  $Œ of Indiamen homewarª-bound--two ships of war, with many
     country ships--a most gratifying sight; though, I confess,
     I felt little pleasure. The remembrance of dear relatives
  $Œ filled me with deep regret, whilst the prospect of being
     instrumental in furthering the Lord‚Äôs work in India filled
     me with joy; and I felt I could forsake all for Christ‚Äôs
     sake.

     ‚ÄúThursday. We came to anchor in Diamond harbour. The
     sailing up the river was delightful; the green herbage
     and foliage most refreshing to the eye; and the numerous
     population raised wonder how provision could be founª for
     so many persons. The whole shore, as far as the eye could
     reach, appeared one continued village on each side. The
     sight of a burying-ground for Europeans at Diamond harbour,
     with several monuments erected therein, tended to lessen
     my joy; as did the death of Captain ---- of the 77th, for
     whom the colours were hoisted half-mast high, and who was
     buried in the sea the evening we lay at anchor, in Saugor
     roads. Captain C----, Ensign W., Parson, and myself, left
     the Alexander in a budgerow,[11] about nine o‚Äôclock, anª
     sailed from Diamond harbour about half past ten in the
     evening.

     ‚ÄúFriday, Sept. 19th. I went on shore in the morning at
     Fulta, and sending some provisions on boarª to my chums,
     remained till flood-tide, which was not till two o‚Äôclock.
     My mind was much gratified with the scene; the green fields
     appearing here and there between the groves, were very
     much like scenes I remembered in England; many birªs were
     singing much like the nightingale; herds of cattle, of the
     buffalo breed, with herdsmen tending them here and there on
     the bank. A dead body floating on the river createª much
     horror in my mind; and the birª calleª the adjutant excited
     much surprise. At Fulta I founª a very elegant inn, anª
     accommodations very reasonable. Having placed a chair at
     the gate-way on the elevateª situation on the bank of the
     river, the opposite bank appeared covered with villages,
     and the surface of the river with boats. I took out my
     bible, and read the 60th chapter of Isaiah. The precious
     promises of the enlargement of Christ‚Äôs Church came with
     much power to my mind; the last verse was very encouraging,
     and raised much joy, from the hope that I might be honoured
     to be one of ‚Äòthe little ones‚Äô who should ‚Äòbecome a
     thousand, and a strong nation.‚Äô The prospect of all these
     swarms of people bowing to the sceptre and dominion of
     Jesus, filled my soul with exultation. I founª much freedom
     in prayer, and spent some time in joy and rejoicing. The
     budgerow being much longer in coming up than was expected,
     occasioned great anxiety; and, to my shame be it spoken,
     impatience. O how fickle is my mind: but Jesus liveth, and
     He changeth not! Blessed be God for Jesus Christ! I came on
     boarª about two o‚Äôclock this afternoon; and we are now at
     anchor about ten miles below Calcutta.

     ‚ÄúSept. 21st, 1806. Yesterday morning, being tired of
     waiting any longer for a fair wind, I left the budgerow
     about five o‚Äôclock, anª came up in the tow-boat to
     Calcutta. The scene on each side of the river was much
     the same as during the preceding day; but being indisposed
     from want of food, and by exposure to the sun, I felt but
  $Œ little lively joy. Read in the Bible, and Newton‚Äôs Hymns;
     and founª much desire to be grateful for preservation
     during the voyage, for meeting with kind friends, anª for
     the abundant supply of every temporal want; above all, that
     notwithstanding my manifold failings, some sense of my
     obligations to God in Christ still remains. The sight of
     Calcutta afforded me great satisfaction: the approach to it
     was tedious; and I felt some impatience at the perversity
     of the boatj√°. Alas, the depravity of my nature is but
  $Œ little subdued! I walked up to the church, and inquired
     in vain for Martyn: went to Doughty‚Äôs hotel, where I met
  $Œ V. at the door, who, I feared, was oppressed in spirit
     and suffering from the effects of climate. I took some
     refreshment, and was about to go forth in quest of Martyn,
     when a note arrived from him, desiring me to go to him in
     the college.[12] I set off immediately, and was received
     by him with the most lively demonstrations of joy. Here I
     was desired to take up my abode; and here I am fixed for
     the present. Mr. Brown,[13] to whom I am indebted for my
     present entertainment, appears a sensible, determined,
     pious man; very different from the descriptions I hearª of
     him during the voyage.‚Äù

On the same day, in which these particulars are noticed in his
journal, Mr. C. sent a letter to his sister; written, as it appears,
at intervals during his voyage, anª communicating information up to
the period of his arrival at Calcutta. The letter itself is not less
remarkable for its plain good sense, than as manifesting that strong
natural affection and love of country, which entered so largely into
the character of the writer:

     ‚ÄúFrom the date of this letter, (Sep. 21st.) you will
     perceive how much longer our voyage has proved than at
     the beginning of it we hoped it would. Twenty weeks are
     completeª since we left Portsmouth: the usual time a voyage
     of the kind occupies is about fifteen weeks. The chief
     part of our delay was between St. Iago, and the Cape of
     Good Hope. Before we arrived at St. Iago, we had fair anª
     strong winds; and since we got rounª the Cape, the weather
     has proved most agreeable. A thousand anxious thoughts
     daily fill my mind on your account: separation from you has
     only tended to show how much my comfort depended on you:
     scarcely for two successive waking hours has your image
     been out of my remembrance. I am very anxious that you
     should come out to me; and I am very anxious respecting
     your voyage. You have little, humanly speaking, to fear
     from dangers of the sea. Your greatest inconvenience
     will arise from not having a person with whom you can
     communicate freely: to be under a restraint of this kind,
     for five months, is a greater evil than you can at present
     suppose. You will, no doubt, hear of some lady coming
     out, with whom you can take half of a cabin; and if such
     an opportunity offers, you need not hesitate to embrace
     it. But you will need to use great caution how you trust
     strangers; and by no means be too familiar with any of
     the passengers, till you have had time to observe their
     dispositions: the evil of a contrary conduct has appeared
     very strikingly with us; and still more so in some other
     of the ships of our fleet. It is very easy to assume an
     appearance of gaiety and good-humour, when people only
     meet occasionally, and for a short time; but when they
     come to live together, anª are obliged to meet each other
     at every turn, without Divine grace, few tempers are founª
     sufficiently accommodating to maintain that forbearance,
     and to make those concessions, which are absolutely
     necessary to peace anª comfort. Hence, when by an unguarªed
     confidence, persons of contrary dispositions and habits
     have committedti imselves to each other, they soon become
     mutually disgusted; family circumstances are exposed;
     weaknesses ridiculed; anª contempt and hatred follows. You
     see I write under the idea that you will not leave Englanª
     till you hear of my arrival in India. I have only to add,
     that my health is much improved since I left you.

     ‚ÄúSince I began this letter, a variety of events have taken
     place, anª crowd so fast on my mind, that I know not
  $Œ where or how to relate them. On entering Madras roads in
     the evening, the lights reflected from the houses built
  $Œ on the shore, with the sounª of the sentinels‚Äô voices
     passing the word, and the striking of the clocks, formed
     altogether the most remarkable impression I recollect in
     life. After having for five months been separated from the
     civilized world in a great measure, and having seen only
     the bounªless ocean, and occasionally hailing some of our
     consorts, you may suppose the entrance into society was
     highly gratifying. My joy was silent, anª chiefly expresseª
     in ejaculations of praise to Him who had so graciously
     preserved us through the great deep; nor were wanting
     prayers for my native lanª, and for the many dear objects
     left behind. This pleasant temper of minª was, however,
     of short continuance, as soon as we came to anchor, some
     of the natives came off in catamarans; they were almost
     naked, and very savage in appearance. The consideration of
     being, in all probability, to spend the remainder of my
     life among such wretched beings, filled me with melancholy;
     and rendered me sleepless during the greater part of the
     night; and the whole of the next day, I was very unhappy.
     But you will perceive my sin and unbelief in this matter;
     as their wretchedness should rather have excited compassion
     and anxiety for bettering their condition: the idea of no
     further comfort remaining for me, certainly arose from the
     absence of the proper influence of that precious truth, ‚ÄòIf
     He give peace, who then can cause trouble?‚Äô I perceive this
     clearly now; and I am thankful that I am able to take the
     comfort of it to myself. During the whole of our stay, the
     anniversary festival of one of their idols was celebrating
     at a pagoda or temple, in sight of the house where we were.
     Their chief solemnities were celebrated during the night;
     and consistedtin most wretchedly bad music, something like
     bad bag-pipes, accompanied with a tom-tom, or small drum
     unbraced, and incapable of music; with these, at intervals,
     loud shouts were set up by the people, and something of a
     song in praise of their idol sung in alternate strains,
  $Œ which were responªed by the people to each other in a
     sing-song tone of voice. O what a blessing is the Gospel
     to mankind! Well might the angels sing at Messiah‚Äôs birth,
     ‚Äògoodwill towarªs men,‚Äô no less than ‚Äòglory to God!‚Äô How
     lovely does Christianity appear, contrastedtwith the
     absurdities of these pitiable heathen! O, how privileged
     is Britain, where Divine truth shines forth in all its
     purity! May my happy native lanª know the value of her
     privileges, and improve i im: O that, to latest ages, her
     rulers may continue nursing fathers, and nursing mothers
     to the Church; anª use their widely-extenªed influence in
     rendering their colonies happy as themselves!‚Äù

                   AT ALDEEN--APPOINTED TO CHUNAR.


On Mr. Corrie‚Äôs arrival in Bengal both he and Mr. Parson took up
their abode with Mr. Brown at Aldeen, a short distance from Calcutta,
and remained under the same hospitable roof until they proceeªed
to the stations that had been assigned to them respectively by the
government. Henry Martyn was their fellow-guest for a time, and with
that honoured servant of God Mr. Corrie‚Äôs intimacy was close and
brotherly. Mr. C. was also in the habit of preaching regularly during
his residence with Mr. Brown, and of maintaining constant intercourse
with the whole body of Christian Missionaries in Calcutta and
Serampore. In his Journal, too, occur many intimations of the anxious
affection with which he regarªed such of the Cadets as remained
within reach of his visits, or were willing to corresponª with him.
A peculiar regarª for the welfare of young persons was, in fact, a
distinguishing feature of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs character.

Early in December 1806, Mr. Corrie and Mr. Parson left Aldeen, the
one having been appointed at Chunar, the other at Berhampore. A√©rrespects Mr. C. it will be seen, that during the whole of his journey
to the place of his destination, the subject of the conversion of the
heathen occupied a large portion of his thoughts.


                    FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF CALCUTTA.

     ‚ÄúCalcutta strikes me as the most magnificent city in
     the world; and I am made most happy by the hope of
     being instrumental to the eternal good of many. A great
     opposition, I find, is raised against Martyn, and the
     principles he preaches; this gives me no uneasiness--by
     the help of God, I will stand fast in the doctrine of
     Christ crucified, and maintain it against all opposition.
     But, Lord, grant me the wisdom that is from above, that I
     may act with discretion, and in nothing give unnecessary
     offence!

     ‚ÄúAt three o‚Äôclock,[14] Martyn preached from Rom. iii.
     21-23, the most impressive and best composition I ever
     heard. The disposition of love and good will which appeared
     in him must have had great effect; and the calmness and
     firmness with which he spoke raised in me great wonªer.
     May God grant a blessing to the word. O may it silence
     opposition, and promote religion for Jesus Christ‚Äôs sake,
     Amen.

     ‚ÄúTuesday, Sept. 30th. I have neglected for some time to
     make a memorandum of occurrences; but remember, that in
     general, my minª has been without any lively sense of
     divine things; though my heart has been going out much
     after God. The joy expressed by the few serious people here
     is very great; and were not those comfortstwithheldtwhich
     I have been some time favoured with, their kinªness would
     have a tenªency to make me proud: for, Oh! I feel an evil
     heart cleaving to the world, though not under its former
     shape. I am not without a secret uneasiness, that I have
     not talents to render me equally acceptable with others.
     This is not to be content with God‚Äôs appointments; though,
     I think, I would not have others brought to my standard,
     but wouldtrise to their‚Äôs, that God may be more glorified.
     I have received great kinªness from Mr. Brown, and much
     benefit from his conversation. Blessed be God, I feel no
     disposition to shrink from the shame of the cross, but
  $Œ hope, with bolªness, to declare myself a fellow-labourer
     with Martyn, in the controversy excited by his preaching.

     ‚ÄúI preached on Sunday [Sept. 28,] evening, at the Mission
     Church, from 2 Thess. i. 7-10: my minª was somewhat
     impressed with the importance of my office, both before
     and during the service. I trust the furtherance of God‚Äôs
     glory, anª the good of souls, was, and is, my prevailing
     desire. Went up to Serampore yesterday, and in the evening
     was present at the marriage of Mr. Desgranges.[15] Mr.
     Brown entered into their concerns with much interest. The
     pagoda[16] was fixed on, and lighted up for the celebration
     of the wedding; at eight o‚Äôclock the parties came from
     the Mission house, [at Serampore] attenªed by most of
     the family. Mr. Brown commenced with the hymn, ‚ÄòCome,
     gracious Spirit, heavenly dove!‚Äô A divine influence seemed
     to attenª us, and most delightful were my sensations. The
     circumstance of so many being engaged in spreading the
     glad tidings of salvation,--the temple of an idol converted
     to the purpose of Christian worship, anª the Divine
     presence felt among us,--filled me with joy unspeakable.
     After the marriage service of the Church of England, Mr.
     Brown gave out ‚Äòthe Wedding hymn;‚Äô anª after signing
     certificates of the marriage, we adjourned to the house,
     where Mr. Brown had proviªed supper. Two hymns given out by
     Mr. Marshman[17] were felt very powerfully. He is a most
     lively, sanguine missionary; his conversation made my heart
     burn within me, and I finª desires of spreading the Gospel
     growing stronger daily, and my zeal in the cause more
     arªent. But O ‚Äòmy leanness‚Äô in comparison of these ‚Äòburning
     and shining lights‚Äô around me. Yet, in the strength of
     Jehovah will I go forward, and will tread in their steps,
     and pursue them at a distance, though I may not hope to
     come near their attainments.

     ‚ÄúOct. 10th. I have for some time past been oppressed with
     a sense of the want of spiritual affections: my heart as
     colª as ice, no mouth to speak of, or for God: deadness in
     prayer, and languor in every spiritual duty. I perceive
     my great insufficiency for the work of the ministry; and
     lament exceedingly my small opportunities of education,[18]
     and my sinful negligence in not better improving those I
     had. ‚ÄòGod be merciful to me a sinner,‚Äô anª perfect praise
     to Himself out of my weak anª unskilful mouth! Last night
     I went to the Mission-house, [at Serampore] and supped
     at the same table with about fifty native converts. The
     triumph of the cross was most eviªent in breaking down
     their prejudices, and uniting them with those who formerly
     were an abomination in their eyes. After supper, they sang
     a Bengalee hymn, many of them with tears of joy; and they
     concluªed with prayer in Bengalee, with eviªent earnestness
     and emotion. My own feelings were too big for utterance.
     O may the time be hastened when every tongue shall confess
     Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father!

     ‚ÄúOn Friday evening, [Oct. 10th.] we had a meeting in the
     pagoda, at which almost all the missionaries, some of their
     wives, and Captain W. attenªed: with a view to commend
     Martyn to the favour and protection of God in his work. The
     Divine presence was with us. I felt more than it would have
     been proper to express. Mr. Brown commenced with a hymn and
     prayer, Mr. Desgranges succeeded him, with much devotion
     and sweetness of expression: Mr. Marshman followed, and
     dwelt particularly on the promising appearance of things;
     and, with much humility, pleaded God‚Äôs promises for the
     enlargement of Zion; with many petitions for Mr. Brown and
     his family. The service was concluªed by Mr. Carey,[19]
     who was earnest in prayer for Mr. Brown: the petition that
     ‚Äòhaving laboured for many years without encouragement or
     support, in the evening it might be light,‚Äô seemed much
     to affect his own minª, and greatly impressed us all.
     Afterwarªs we supped together at Mr. Brown‚Äôs. The influence
     of this association remained on my minª, and shed a divine
     peace anª composure through my soul.

     ‚ÄúSunday 12th. This day I preached at the New Church from
     Gal. vi. 14. The Governor General, &c., attenªed. I felt a
     good deal of palpitation before I ascenªed the pulpit, but
     afterwarªs experienced great composure of mind; and had no
     idea that any one woulª be offenªed, being conscious that I
     was speaking the truth. I found much earnestness in prayer
     before, anª after, divine service. God grant an increase to
     His own word for Jesus Christ‚Äôs sake!

     ‚ÄúOct. 13th. I came to Serampore to dinner. Had a
     pleasant sail up the river: the time passed agreeably in
     conversation. In the evening a fire was kinªled on the
     opposite bank; and we soon perceived that it was a funeral
     pile, on which the wife was burning with the dead body of
     her husband. It was too dark to distinguish the miserable
     victim of superstition; but by the light of the flames
     we coulª discover a great crowd of people: their horrid
     noise, and senseless music, joined with the testimony of
     some of the servants, convinced us that our apprehensions
     were founded on fact. The noise continued till ten o‚Äôclock,
     and the fire was kept burning till that time. My minª was
     struck with horror and pity. On going out to walk with
     Martyn to the pagoda, the noise so unnatural, and so little
     calculated to excite joy, raised in my minª an awful sense
     of the presence and influence of evil spirits. O that
     the Lord would command his word to run and be glorified,
     in casting them out, anª placing in their stead the mild
     influence of his Gospel!

     ‚ÄúOct. 18th, 1806. On Wednesday last, Mr. Brown, Parson
     and myself proceeded up the river with Martyn, to set him
     on his way to Dinapore. We landed at Ghyretee, anª walked
     through a most delightful avenue; afterwarªs through a neat
     village (for this country), anª arrived at Chandernagore
     about seven o‚Äôclock: we took tea at a tavern, and went
     on boarª our budgerow, about nine o‚Äôclock. After joining
     in prayer, we retired to rest. On Thursday morning,
     we proceeded to Chinsurah, on foot, through groves of
     fruit trees; we arrived at Chinsurah soon after seven
     o‚Äôclock, and received a most hospitable reception from
     Mr. Forsyth:[20] after dinner, we went with Mr. F. above
     Bandell; and after worship, returned to Chinsurah in &
     _paunchway_.[21] Yesterday morning, the weather having
     commenced rainy, we determined to return to Aldeen, on
     account of Mr. Brown‚Äôs boat becoming uninhabitable. We
     first engaged, according to arrangement, in alternate
     prayer. Mr. Brown commenced with reading a portion of
     Scripture, singing a hymn, and prayer, which order was
     observed by P., myself, and Martyn. A sense of the Divine
     presence was experienced by each of us, and our consolation
     in Christ Jesus abounªed; so that we left our friend
     without regret, and he parted with us cheerfully; each
     persuaded that God was with us, and woulª be our ‚Äòshield
     and exceeding great rewarª.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúOct. 22nd. On coming down the river, I saw the figures
     of Doorga[22] paraded on the river, and the inªecencies
     of idol-worship. My minª was inexpressibly grieved; and
     most earnestly did I desire to be able to address the poor
     deluªed heathen.

     ‚ÄúNov. 3rª. For some time past I have made no memoranda
     of the state of my minª. Alas, my wretched backwarªness
     to any really good thing! In general my heart has been
     harª and insensible, though my desire has been to the
     contrary; and I have had but little inclination to pray,
     though no disposition to give up prayer; and sometimes haveev√©l experienced enlargement of heart, and melting of soul in
     prayer. I have preached several times at the Olª Church,
     and once at the New. My purposes of labouring among the
     heathen are, I bless God, more fixed; and a desire to be at
     my station, and about my proper work, grows upon me.

     ‚ÄúWhen I hear of a spirit of covetousness which has affected
     many, I fear and tremble; and I think something of that
     disposition was working within me this morning. Oh! how
     often have I said that I desire not to leave one shilling
     behind me at death. I woulª record my own declaration,
     beseeching thee, O Lord, that I may be enabled to trust
     thee for future supplies, and to live by faith upon thee
     for daily bread!

     ‚Äú24th, For some days past my minª has enjoyed quiet and
     peace with God; my inªisposition has been in a great
     measure removed, and I can speak anª act as usual. ‚ÄòPraise
     God from whom all blessings flow.‚Äô My minª has been calm
     and resigned to the will of God, in the prospect of my
     destination, and in my preparation to set out for Chunar;
     but little, alas! of lively affection, with much wandering
     of heart in prayer. The youths who came out with me haveev√©l been much on my minª. My dear relatives have not had so
     particular an interest in my prayers as at some other
     times; but their welfare is exceedingly dear to me, and the
     prospect of having my sister with me very cheering.

     ‚ÄúNov. 29th. This morning Mr. Brown, Parson, Mr.
     Thompson[23] (of Madras), anª myself, met in the pagoda
     at Aldeen, to consult in what way we may most effectually
     promote the glory of our redeeming God in the earth. After
     prayer by Mr. Brown, and after some conversation, we
     agreed, 1st. To join in the views, and aid to the utmost of
     our power, the purposes of the British and Foreign Bible
     Society: 2ndly. To help forwarª the translation of the
     Scriptures into the languages of the East, as much as in
     us lies; and to take the expense of the Sanscrit anª Greek
     Testaments upon ourselves: anª 3rdly. To make a quarterly
     report of our prospects, our plans, anª actual situation in
     our various stations, as far as the Church is concerned, to
     Mr. Brown; who will add his own, and cause a copy of the
     whole to be transmitted to each inªividual. After prayer we
     separated.

     ‚ÄúDec. 8. To-day set off for Chunar. In the strength of the
     Lord God I go forth. O, prepare a people for Thyself, and
     make me the instrument of gathering them into thy fold!
     Keep me by thy mighty power in body and soul; and enlarge
     my heart that I may delight in Thy will, and lay out all my
     time and labour in Thy service! Amen, Lord Jesus. Amen!

     ‚ÄúDec. 13th. On Monday last Parson anª myself left Aldeen,
     to proceed to our stations; Mr. Brown and Mr. Thompson
     accompanying us. We arrived at Chinsurah about three
     o‚Äôclock, after a quick sail up the river, the tide being
     in our favour: we called on Mr. Forsyth, with whom we
     spent the evening. Mr. F. conducted family worship, and
     was excellent in the application, and very fervent for
     the fulfilment of many precious promises. The presence of
     God was with us. Mr. F. gave me favourable intelligence
     respecting General M. at Chunar, to which place Mr. L.
     had sent tracts, which had been noticeª with approbation
     by the General. I hope the Lord has prepared my way.
     Yesterday morning, after breakfast and family worship, we
     set forwarª, Mr. Forsyth accompanying us. In the evening
     we walked on the bank, whilst the boatmen hauled our boat
     along. The encouragement and comfort his conversation
     raised in my mind will, I hope, never be forgotten: much
     lively and spiritual conversation passed, chiefly on
     the means most suitable for us to employ under presentev√©l circumstances. We concluded by commissioning Messrs. Brown
     and T. to buy Bibles, Testaments, and Common Prayer-books,
     to be sent to us from time to time for distribution. Our
     friends left us to return to Calcutta. A sweet composure
     fills my heart: and, without regret, I leave all that earth
     and sense hold dear, to do thy will, O my God! Let me find
     strength according to my day; and call Thou me to any
     thing in which I may most glorify Thee. Leave me not for a
     moment; for though now, ‚Äòby thy goodness, thou hast made
     my mountain strong,‚Äô yet if thou hide thy face I shall be
     ‚Äòtroubled!‚Äô

     ‚ÄúDec. 14th. Yesterday morning we left Sook Saugur: in the
     afternoon our attention was arrested by loud lamentations:
     we observeª a dying man put into the river to expire; this,
     in the opinion of the Hinªoos, insuring Paradise. We were
     much shocked at the spectacle. Lorª, how long, how long
     shall Satan triumph? Four out of six are killed in this
     way, and hurried out of life.‚Äù

On the 16th of December, Mr. Corrie writes to his father:--

     ‚ÄúI am now on my way to my station at Chunar, five days‚Äô
     journey from Calcutta, and three from Berhampore. To this
     last place Parson is appointed, and we are together in
     the same boat; after which I have eight weeks‚Äô journey
     alone. I have, however, several introductions to christian
     friends on the way, and Martyn‚Äôs station is before me,
     where I intend to stay a few days with him. My mind is at
     perfect ease, anª my soul happy in the love of God, and
     overflowing with gratitude to the Giver of all good. Much
     and unexpected kinªness has been shewn me in this strange
     land; and I have found that whosoever forsaketh aught for
     Christ shall reap an hundred-fold ‚Äòin the present life:‚Äô
     how, then, can I doubt the fulfilment of that part of the
     promise which relates to the life to come? In the house
     of Mr. Brown, every attention that affection could think
     of has been shewn me.... The country through which we
     have come, is, in general, very pleasant, though flat. We
     walk on the bank morning and evening; anª amuse ourselves
     with finªing out resemblances, or fancied resemblances to
     scenes we remember in Britain. We have every comfort we can
     wish for; and our morning and evening worship, consisting
     of singing, prayer, and reading the Scriptures, tends to
     revive our souls; whilst we walk as friends, and take sweetev√©l counsel together on the ends anª means we purpose in our
     ministry. I have written so often that I forget what I
     may have said to you; but you who know how much I am the
     creature of impulse in every thing--except my expressions
     of affection for you all, and in matters of fact,--will
     not judge of the state of my mind from one single letter.
     I allude especially to what I have written respecting the
     conversion of the heathen. _You_ know, what _I_ now know,
     how sanguine I am in schemes that my soul enters into; and
     oft have I made calculations and statements which have
     afterwarªs made me blush.--The state of society among our
     own countrymen here is much altered for the better within
     these few years. The Marquis Wellesley openly patronized
     religion; whether from motives of state policy or not, it
     is not ours to judge. He on every possible opportunity,
     made moral character a _sine qu√¢ non_ to his patronage,
     and sought for men of character from every quarter to fill
     offices of trust. He avowedly encouraged, and contributed
     to, the translation of the Scriptures into the native
     languages; and wherever he went, paid a strict regarª to
     divine worship on the Sunday. Before his time, all causes
     were tried in the courts of justice, through the medium of
     interpreters; but by the College which he instituted, he
     furnished the natives with judges capable of determining
     from their own knowledge of the language, and judgment on
     the evidence; and has thus laid the foundation of peace
     and justice, such as Asia before knew not. _He has been
     the saviour of India to Britain._ The state of the natives
     in a moral point of view is deplorable; the most shocking
     indecencies form a part of their worship; and lying,ev√©l cheating, &c., are not considered crimes. Two youths who
     were seriously impressed during the voyage, and one who
     was our fellow-passenger, and has since been brought to
     consideration, are going on consistently in the ways of
     wisdom. These first-fruits of our Indian engagement afford
     me the most lively encouragement, and the strongest hope
     that God is with me of a truth. O may He be a spirit of
     power in my own heart, and a word of power in my mouth,
     that many may be turned unto righteousness: then I am sure
     that you will bless the day that took me from you, and we
     shall rejoice together in the loving-kinªness of our God!‚Äù

But to return to the Journal:

     ‚ÄúDecember 18th. This evening we are at Plassy. Walking on
     the bank of the river, we passed an olª man brought down to
     die by the river-side: he exhibited signs of considerable
     vitality; and certainly no symptoms of immediate
     dissolution. My spirit was stirred within me; and a Brahminev√©l coming past, I began to talk to him on the wickeªness of
     killing men in this way. He said his shasters[24] commanªed
     it, and that the doctor had pronounced the man dying. I
     told him that God did no injury to man; that He was good;
     and, therefore, the shasters were not God‚Äôs word; and that
mozduGod was displeaseª at such proceedings; he understood me,
     and pleaded their customs. I answered, that the custom,
     the shasters, and the people, were all bad; and that
mozduwhen he died he would go down and lie in fire for ever.
     He evidently understood me and seemed confounded. I then
     told him that at Cutwa, a Sahib lived, who would give him
     the true word of God, and recommenªed him to go there. Itev√©l appeared, however, that he came from Moorshedebad, and
     showed no disposition to return to Cutwa. Passing on, we
     found a party going to Juggernauth. I asked one of them,
     Why he went there? What use it would be to him, and whatev√©l good it would do to him? He seemed confounded, anª made no
     reply. I told him also of the anger of God, and of the fire
     after death. A Birajee[25] came running after us to beg; he
     was an olª man. On being told by him what he was, I said
     to him, that he was a lazy man that would do no work, but
     only eat, and that God was angry with him, and that when he
     died he would go down to fire for ever. He was surpriseª at
     this reception, and coulª only plead his age. I recommenªed
     him to Cutwa. This is my first effort at missionary work:
     but O, how I blush, and abhor myself, for the imperfect
     manner I speak for God. I know enough of the language to
     have conveyed different ideas, and more of them, but I
     am nothing, and know nothing. Lord, grant me wisdom and
     utterance; and, O, smile on my feeble attempts for the
     furtherance of thine own glory, through Christ Jesus!

     ‚ÄúDec. 21st. We are now by the kind providence of God at
mozduBerhampore. On Friday Mr. Grant and Mr. Ellerton std, ed
     our boat, about one o‚Äôclock, and we stayeª at that place
     all night. We met, also, with Messrs. B. and their
     frienªs; one a youth from England, by the Nelson. They
     also stayeª with us; and in the evening, we were joined by
     two officers, going down to Calcutta. We made a party of
     eight, and sat up till twelve, talking to little profit,ev√©l chiefly about the siege of Bhurtpore. Yesterday morning
     we separated, and were accompanied the whole of the day by
     the Messrs. B., who joined with us in morning and evening
     worship.

     ‚ÄúDec. 23rd, 1806. (Bogwongola). Yesterday morning we waited
     on General P. and afterwards visited the plt k appointed
     for public worship, a large upper room. In the afternoon,
     we visited the hospital. I drew near the bed of a manev√©l apparently in the last stage of disease, who received the
     word with tears, and requested me to pray with him. Having
     made this known, P. invited the others to draw near: a
     large party collected from all parts of the hospital. I
     expounded the third chapter of St. John‚Äôs Gospel, and
     prayed. Much attention in the poor men.

     ‚ÄúI leftuBerhampore this morning at seven o‚Äôclock; and,
     after passing through a well-cultivated and fertile
     country, arrived here at twelve. I am now on the great
     river, proceeding to Mr. Creighton[26] at Gomalty. I am
     much pained at heart on account of separation from dear
     Parson, and dishearteneª at the prospect of being so long
     on the way to Chunar; and tired with the importunity of the
     natives. Never, never have I felt so keenly the separation
     from dear relatives; but I have no wish to draw back, but
     would pray and hope that ‚ÄúGod will be the strength of my
     heart, anª my portion for ever,‚Äù in and through Jesus
     Christ.

     ‚ÄúDec. 26th. Last night I arrived at Gomalty, and found
     a very kind reception from Mr. Creighton. In the course
     of conversation, I have learned that he, with Messrs.
     Ellerton and Grant, have instituted about twelve schools
     in the villages, in this neighbourhood, in which many
     children of the poor natives are taught to read and write;
     and christian tracts, and the New Testament in Bengalee
     are read to them, and by them. One Brahmin objected to
     the reading the Holy Scirptures; but, some parts of them
     being read to him, his objections were removed, and he
     considered that they were very good. In one of the schools
     the master is a Brahmin, who teaches these tracts, &c.;
     though he says, that if the sentiments contained in them
     prevail, the Brahmin‚Äôs power will soon be at an enª.
     The salary allowed the teachers is five rupees[27] per
     month; for which they teach as many children as choose
     to come. In one school about seventy or eighty children
     attendeª at first; and about forty still continue to
     come. In this school thirty have been taught, and are
     gone off to different employments. Many of the boys have
     made considerable proficiency in reading and writineseand
     through them, the knowledge of the Scriptures is diffuseª
     to a considerable extent; the consequence is, that much
     less dissension is found in the neighbourhood; so that when
     the native missionaries come amongst them, the people are
     much more ready to hear them than in other districts. They
     hear, also, with much attention, and in general approve of
     Christian truth.

     ‚ÄúDec. 27th. To-day Mr. Creighton sent for the schoolmaster
     of the plt k with his little charge, about fourteen: some
     others were in the habit of attending, but were at this
     time absent. The method of teaching is by writine the
     character in the sand, and then pronouncing the letter;
     thus they learn both to read and write at the same time:
mozdusome of the children have made considerable advancement.
     The manners of the children are much the same as those
     of children at home; and much gratification did their
     contented ft ks and their little tricks afford me.

     ‚ÄúDec. 29th. Yesterday morning Messrs. W. the two B‚Äôs and
     A. came over to attend Divine worship. At ten o‚Äôclock we
     went and heard the Bengalee missionaries preach to their
     countrymen: the three appear to be humble and sincere
     Christians. Those who understood them say, that the
     preaching was very energetic and eloquent.

     ‚ÄúGomalty, Jan. 1st. 1807. I would begin the new year by
     reviewing the old. The mercies of the past year are
     many and great; and, for these mercies, I am bound to be
     exceedingly thankful. During the voyage, my attempts were
     not without some good effects on the minds of V. and Y.
     especially: the Lord made my presence a restraint on some
     who would otherwise have been more profane, and gave me
     favour in the sight of many: kind friends have been raised
     up for me in India, wherever I have come, and all my wants
     have been abundantly supplied. These mercies call for the
     loudest praise to Him who rules on high; but especially do
     spiritual mercies call for gratitude: that I have been kept
     from gross sins before men; that I have not been permitted
     wholly to restrain prayer before God, or to cast off His
     fear; that I have been enabled in public preaching to
     declare what I believe to be the whole counsel of God; and
     that some tokens of Divine approbation have been granteª
     to His word. I feel a growing boldness to speak for God in
     private, and something more of a power to cast off the fear
     of man. These are subjects which may well furnish matter
     for everlasting songs. I would record what I feel still
     wrong, that I may be disposed to live more simply on Christ
     for strength as well as righteousness. I find a disposition
     to seek the applause of men, which sometimes leads me into
     words and actions which grieve the Holy Spirit, and wound
     my own soul. There is a sinful nature; a disposition to
     rest in the form of godliness; and a spirit of indolence
     which causes me to waste hours and days to no profit.
     These things grieve and bow down my soul. I would, also,
     record my purposes, that I may be bound to perform them. I
     intend to keep aloof from visiting parties at Chunar, as
     much as I can; to establish worship as often as possible;
     and to teach and preach Jesus Christ, ‚Äòpublicly and from
     house to house,‚Äô both to professed Christians, and to the
     heathen. But, when I reflect how most of my resolutions
     have hitherto come to nothing, O Lord, let thy power rest
     upon me! I would record my most earnest desires, to mark
     the Lord‚Äôs dealings with me, and His answers to prayer. My
     first desire is, that a ‚Äòdoor may be opened‚Äô at Chunar,
     and that I may have power to enter in thereat, that so
     ‚Äòthe word of God may have free course and be glorified‚Äô
     in the conversion of souls. Secondly, that my dear family
     may be the special objects of the favour of Jehovah; and
     that my dear sister may come out to me, _if it be the will
     of God, otherwise not_. Thirdly, that V., Y., and B., may
     be kept from the power of the devil, the world, and the
     flesh; and that they may be redeemed and preserved from
     all iniquity, and have liberty to serve God without fear.
     Fourthly, that the choi kst mercies both of Providence and
     Grace, may descend on all whose hearts have been disposed
     to favour me; and that the Government of India may be
     disposed to _permit_, at least, attempts for the conversion
     of the natives; and that the kinedom of Christ may come.
     And, O Lord, I would devote my life, my strength, my every
     faculty, and every gift of grace, nature, or providence,
     wholly to thy service and glory! I offer myself to Thee.
     O pardon, accept, and bless me, through Jesus Christ; and
     bring these purposes to good effect, for thy name‚Äôs sake!

     ‚ÄúJan. 6th. Left Mr. Creighton at Gomalty yesterday morning.
     In travelling, found my mind somewhat stayed on God. I
     welcomed the budgerow, and the dreary river, as old though
     inconvenient friends, who would put me in the way of active
     usefulness. I was much pleased with the school in Mr. C.‚Äôs
     bungalow; and, from the pleasure the Brahmin showed, in
     makine the scholars read the Bengalee New Testament, I have
     a hopeful presentiment that the kinedom of Satan, thus
     divided against itself, cannot stand long.

     ‚ÄúJan. 16th. This morning, I visited the wells near
     Monghyr.[28] One of the wells is cold; but close to it,
     another bubbles up water, like the bubbles that rise from
     the bottom of a caldron as the water grows hot. I found
     this water so hot, that I was scarcely able to bear my
     hand in it. Here, they say, Ram‚Äôs wife bathed, after she
     had been stolen away, and recovered again by her husband.
     Many Brahmins and Faqueers were staying there; and were
     very importunate for money. With a _buckshish_[29] I
     offered tracts, and was immediately told that a Sahib, a
     short time since, had left many. A very interesting boy,
     about fifteen years of age, read in one of the tracts, and
     told me that it meant, There is only one God, and that all
     their poojahs, &c., are vain. I spoke to him, and an old
     man, with several around; the boy seemed to understand
     perfectly what I meant; and said, that when he understood
     the matter thoroughly, he should leave off poojah; and,
     as I spake of hell as the portion of wicked men, several
     behind showed symptoms of scorn. The old man discovered
     much impatience, but, for the _buckshish_, stayed till I
     had said all that I thought necessary. The boy‚Äôs father
     manifested uneasiness, and evidently wished his son away;
     but for the same reason permitted him to stay. The father
     said, that Adam was first created, and that all men are his
     children: that the world was drowned, and then Noah became
     the parent of us all. I replied that it was true; and that
     Adam and Noah worshipped God, and paid no regard to poojahs
     and the river. Why, then, did they pay that regard to the
     creature, which was due only to God? He answered, that when
     God should give all the world to be of the same opinion, it
     would be so. To which I replied, That it was true; and that
     in England we worshipped God as Adam and Noah did; and that
     now the word was sent to him.

     ‚ÄúJan. 26th. On Friday, I left the budgerow, and came
     through a most fertile country to Dinapore. I observed some
     of the customs of the natives which explained passages of
     Scripture. In the evening, the conversation of dear Martyn
     seemed to drive away all pain; but weakness soon made me
     wish for rkst. Yesterday, I preached here to an attentive
     people, from Matt. vii. 21-23. Some of the offi krs
     scoffed. Oh! what cause for thankfulness in the sweet
     communion I am favoured with in Martyn, and in the kindness
     I meet with on all hands! O for a heart to praise the Lord
     for his goodness! O for power to do His will, to love His
     work; and for a spirit of compassion for perishing souls!

     ‚ÄúJan. 29th. Just leaving Dinapore to proceed to Chunar, in
     tolerable health and spirits. I have found but little of
     spiritual comfort; though much pleasure in communion with
     dear Martyn. My purposes of labouring amongst the heathen
     are much revived, encouraged and strengthened, by the
     conversation of this dear friend: we agreed to exchange
     letters every other Monday. I found the vanity of worldly
     pursuits in the society I went into; and perceive afresh
     that God is alone the fit and satisfying portion of the
     soul. O may I live under this impression, and may my life
     and conduct testify that it is a divine impression!

     ‚ÄúFeb. 15th. On approaching Chunar, the appearance of
     the fort struck me as beautiful; but, from the reports
     of its unhealthiness, I was ready to consider it as my
     grave, and approached it with a heavy heart. I have found
     some earnestness and liberty in praying for a blessine
     on my entrance in amongst them. I trust the Lord will be
     entreated.‚Äù

                        SETTLEMENT AT CHUNAR.


Chunar, the first scene of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs stated ministry in India,
used to be a place of greater importance than it is now that the
frontier of the British Empire has been so much extended in all
directions. The fortress is spread over the sides of a high rock
which is washed by the Ganges; and although the place is not
considered unhealthy, yet during some months in the year, the heat
at Chunar is intense. The Europeans stationed there, when Mr. C.
was chaplain, were all military, and for the most part invalids,
who, though unfit for active service, were equal to garrison-duty.
Besides those Europeans and some Sepoys, there were a few half-castes
of Portuguese extraction, and some native women who followed the
army. Without the cantonments was a Hindoo and Mahomedan population
amounting to 10,000 or 12,000 souls. The Europeans, also, at Secrole
(about twelve miles from Chunar) became afterwards part of Mr.
Corrie‚Äôs charge; whilst the vast heathen population of Benares, with
its cruel and senseless superstitions, opened out a large field for
the exercise of missionary zeal and christian philanthropy.

The extracts given below from Mr. Corrie‚Äôs journal and Letters,
will explain the nature of his offi ial duties, and missionary
operations. It will be seen that he had many obstacles to encounter
in his efforts to impart the knowledge of Christ to those ‚Äúwho lay
in darkness and in the shadow of death.‚Äù[30] Among the many trials,
too, which his faith had to sustain, not the least will appear to
have arisen from the determined hostility to all missionary labours,
manifested by the Government of India; in forgetfulness, it may be
presumed, of the great truth, that as ‚Äúthe kingdoms of this world
are‚Äù destined to ‚Äúbecome the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ,‚Äù
all opposition to the spread of Christianity is hostility to the
‚ÄúKing of kings.‚Äù[31]

     ‚ÄúSunday, Feb. 22nd. This day I begin my labours at Chunar,
     and have much reason to adore him who heareth prayer, for
     smoothing my way, and opening a door of hope that good will
     be done. I arose at five o‚Äôclock this morning and prepared
     for divine service. At seven o‚Äôclock, I went to the place
     of worship, and found there the effective artillery-men,
     the garrison invalids, and several of the others, with the
     Colonel, Captain P., Lieut. A., and the invalid offi ers
     D. and H. with some other offi ers of the Fort. Observed
     several very attentive. At half past nine o‚Äôclock I went to
     the hospital, and found a table set, and the people very
     ready to hear, and attentive. Now, O Lord,

              ‚ÄúDo thou the gracious harvest raise,
               And thine alone shall be the praise.‚Äù

     ‚ÄúFeb. 25th. This evening I went to see the Roman Catholic
     chapel, a small place of about eight feet square,
     surrounded with a veranda. A dish with spices, and another
     with flour, were placed on the altar. A Padre comes
     occasionally, but he has not been here for the last two
     years; he has baptized several native women connected with
     Europeans; but I cannot find that any other natives have
     been baptized by him.

     ‚ÄúFeb. 27th. Yesterday and to-day, I had an opportunity of
     talking with some poor women, Portuguese Roman Catholics,
     about Jesus Christ; and found some relief to my own mind in
     recommending Him to their regard. From one I learned (what
     indeed I had heard before) that at Bettiah, situate in what
     used to be the old kingdom of Nepaul, eight days‚Äô journey
     inland from Chuprah, all the inhabitants are Roman Catholic
     christians: a padre resides amongst them, and they have a
     church.

     ‚ÄúMarch 8th. The week has passed with little profit. I
     received a letter from dear Martyn,[32] which comforted
     me not a little. On returning from public service, I
     found some earnestness in prayer to God for my flock;
     for the Church in India; and her ministers; for my dear
     relatives; for my former flock, and all who pray for me;
     but espe ially for my dear country, her government, her
     ministers, her people; and for all christians. After dinner
     I called in the Bettiah-christian,[33] and found him
     intelligent, and very attentive to his padre. He gave me
     the history of the creation and fall of man, with a mixture
     of fable, and some confusion in the connexion. He seems to
     know nothing experimentally of Christ; and, if I understood
     him rightly, considers that the sin of Adam, which fell
     upon his posterity, is removed by Christ; and that now by
     attending to the sacraments we obtain pardon of sin. God
     grant me wisdom to deal prudently with him: he appears
     sin ere, but not very humble.

     ‚ÄúMarch 9th. This morning I went to the hospital, in
     consequence of a message from a native woman, who is
     desirous of baptism: she appeared anxious to go in God‚Äôs
     way, as she expressed it; and with tears said, that from
     her heart she desired baptism. On my asking her whether she
     was a sinner? She replied, That before, or towards God, she
     was a sinner: but on being further questioned, confessed
     she did not know wherein she had done amiss, except it were
     in living in an unmarried state; looking wistfully at the
     man. I took occasion, from this confession, to speak of the
     evil of this circumstance, and of the only way of obtaining
     forgiveness, through the blood of Christ. She promised to
     keep this word in her heart, and to pray according to my
     directions. The man appears sensible of the evil of his
     present habits; and promises that, if the woman lives, he
     will marry her. I am at a loss how to proceed: to refuse
     her baptism will evidently be a grief to her; and I hope
     she is awakened to a sense of her sin. May the Lord direct
     me!

     ‚ÄúMarch 15th. I went yesterday evening to the barracks; and
     if circumstances had been favourable, should have married
     the persons above-mentioned; but find I should have broken
     military regulations if I had done so. To-day, the man
     seems unwilling; but the woman expressed dread at the
     thought of continuing in sin. I have observed, on several
     occasions, when explaining christian subjects through a
     native who understands English, that they [the natives]
     have a great reluctance to speak of Jesus Christ, and never
     do it till I urge it again.

     ‚ÄúMarch 17th. A letter from dear Martyn dispirits me;[34]
     as, from the dislike manifested to his schools, I may see
     how little is to be hoped for: yet we expect opposition;
     why then should I be dismayed? O my soul! hope in God!
     Notwithstanding, I have engaged a schoolmaster, and am
     waiting to see the result. I have employed myself to-day in
     translating the ten commandments into Hindoostanee, with
     the assistance of a moonshee. He could not, for a long
     time, understand why God is called a ‚Äòjealous God.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúMarch 18th. A native woman has been with me, expressing
     her desire for baptism. I made the moonshee read to her
     the ten commandments; and could not help smiling to hear
     one Hindoo explain the law of God to another: she exhibits
     no humility. The Bettiah-christian pleased me much this
     evening: he mentioned four good works which God approved
     of; three of which I understood to be faith, love, and
     obedience to the law. I replied, that if faith was in the
     heart, all the other good works would follow; if we really
     believed the love of Christ to sinners, we must love Him
     in return. He answered, that it was true; and said, If
     faith is not in the heart, none of the other graces would
     be there. All this was said with a seriousness and gravity
     which looked very like sin erity, if it was not really so.
     A female attending the woman who has applied for baptism,
     interfering very improperly, was desired to hold her peace.
     She left the room with marks of great anger, having before
     exhibited symptoms of uneasiness; especially when the
     seventh commandment was repeated. So does Satan rage when
     his strongholds are attacked!

     ‚ÄúMarch 22nd. In conversation with Mooney Lol and Moonshee,
     on the necessity of making inquiry for ourselves in matters
     of the soul, I remarked an expression which has dwelt
     much on my mind: ‚ÄòWhen we have a king of our own to order
     us in the right way, we will then walk in it.‚Äô This, with
     other circumstances, convinces me of the impolicy of the
     Government, in withholding Christianity from the natives.
     They are tasting of British liberty; but, having no
     principles to guide them, when they feel their strength,
     they will expel the British; whereas now, if missionaries
     were permitted, they would, in two generations, probably
     all embrace Christianity.

     ‚ÄúMarch 26th. This evening, after conversation with the
     native woman, I baptized her, with earnest warning not to
     trust to the outward sign. She said, She had been a sinner,
     but that she would pray to Jesus, night and day, to make
     her free from sin, and would be His slave, and serve Him
     for ever. After the service she cast her eyes up to heaven,
     and kept them fixed for some time, with an appearance of
     most ardent supplication. Afterwards I went home with
     Sergeant M‚ÄôD., whose wife, though a Roman Catholic, wishes
     to communicate.

     ‚ÄúApril 2nd. Yesterday morning I went to the barracks. I
     asked the native woman whom I lately baptized, whether she
     prayed? She answered, ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhat do you pray to God for?‚Äô
     ‚ÄòTo make me well in this world if He pleases; and if not,
     to take me to Himself.‚Äô I endeavoured to impress on her
     the necessity of asking all in Christ‚Äôs name; which she
     seemed to attend to very diligently. The man was impressed.
     In the evening I went to bury a child; and spoke to three
     invalids, plainly and at length, on the necessity of
     winning Christ.

     ‚ÄúApril 6th. I learned from the Moonshee that the old
     schoolmaster, in order to keep his scholars from the free
     school, circulated a report that I should send the children
     to Calcutta; which, it seems, keeps many back; but this
     notion, however, is now done away with.

     ‚ÄúApril 8th. Yesterday the Bettiah-walla came again after an
     absence of a fortnight. He said he had been unwell; and
     his appearance bespoke it. He told me that he was poor and
     helpless without Jesus Christ. To-day he came again, and
     read, with evident interest, the fourteenth and fifteenth
     chapters of St. John; especially the promise of being one
     with God and Christ. The account of the fruitless branches
     also impressed him; and he confessed that his heart was
     backward towards God. This morning the children of the
     school came to me: I was much struck with their appearance,
     and artless manners. The Bettiah-walla received the ten
     commandments with reluctance: the second is not in his
     number. I took several occasions of pointing out to him the
     name of Jesus, as the only medium of access to God; and
     observed that we must not pray to saints. At hearing this,
     his countenance fell. O that the Lord may lead him into all
     truth!

     ‚ÄúApril 10th, 1807. This day I have completed my thirtieth
     year. I have been reviewing my birth-day memoranda, and
     I feel quite abased. Alas! where is the blessedness I
     experien ed some time back; or was I then under a mistake
     as to my real state? I suspect that much of animal feeling
     mixed with my former experien e, for I think my soul is as
     fixed as ever, in knowing nothing upon earth but ‚ÄòJesus
     Christ and him crucified.‚Äô Yet, O my God (for mine thou
     art) search me! The Lord‚Äôs mercies to me are innumerable:
     if I should attempt to number them, they exceed the minutes
     of my existence; but alas! my heart is insensible; my
     affections are as cold as ice: I am become a stone to the
     fear of death; and the terror of the Lord, rather than
     the sweet love of Jesus Christ, seems to constrain all
     my doings. There is not a desire, I think, to keep back
     a tittle of God‚Äôs word. I even feel the time long till
     the Lord‚Äôs day returns, that I may have an opportunity of
     warning poor sinners: yet when it comes my heart is heavy;
     and I go with a kind of sullenness and desponding tardiness
     to God‚Äôs work. O that it were with me as in months past!
     The Lord has marvellously hid me from the strife of
     tongues, has wonderfully supported my feeble mind, has
     enabled me to seek the salvation of souls with a boldness
     unusual to my nature; and has given testimony to the word
     of His grace in this place. He supports me in solitude, and
     enables me to spend days alone without weariness: praised
     be His name! The undivided and glorious Trinity are worthy
     of my adoration and love. O rather let me go mourning thy
     absence to the grave than attempt to satisfy my soul with
     contemptible trash! Yet, in thy manifold mercies, let me
     taste thy love, and praise thee in the use of all that thou
     bestowest! The prosperity of Zion is my earnest desire:
     the conversion of the British and the heathen, the success
     of my preaching, schools, and private attempts [to do
     good] are the subjects of my daily prayer. O that the Lord
     would bless these feeble efforts, would perfect that which
     belongeth unto me! Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my
     soul and body: and look with humble hope to be kept by thy
     power through faith unto salvation.

     ‚ÄúMartyn alarms me by expressing a wish for my removal.[35]
     I feel very reluctant to it; and am enabled to resign
     myself to God in prayer, even to die here; if, in this way,
     He will be more glorified.

     ‚ÄúApril 12th. This evening, I buried the native woman whom
     I lately baptized; and spoke to the people from 1 Cor. xv.
     33. ‚ÄòEvil communications corrupt good manners.‚Äô O Lord,
     grant thy blessing! Let thy promise come, and then shall
     sinners in great numbers be converted unto thee!‚Äù

The following Letter to Mr. Buckworth dated May 22nd, 1807, contains
some interesting particulars of which there is no record in the
Journal:--

     ‚ÄúFrom the first of January till the beginning of this
     month, I was much affected by this climate; and did
     not begin to recover till April. Thanks to a kind
     Providen e, I am now quite well; and have escaped that
     first attack on arrival, which has carried off four of my
     fellow-passengers. The effect of this climate was felt as
     severely by my mind as my body: a listlessness and languor
     rendered any little exertion a burden: even my devotion was
     for the most without life or activity; and, alas! little
     of that lively spirit I, in some poor measure, enjoyed
     in England, remains with me. I bless God who enables me
     to live on Christ as my ‚ÄòAll in All‚Äô and keeps alive in
     my heart a sense of the value of His favour, and the
     excellency of the ‚Äòpurchased possession.‚Äô The absence of
     lively feeling I conceive to be occasioned by the want
     of ‚Äòthe communion of saints;‚Äô and I remember, with tears
     sometimes, those days ‚Äòwhen I went to the house of God with
     the multitude of those that kept holy day.‚Äô I am very far,
     however, from being without marks of the Divine favour: I
     am enabled to spend weeks alone without weariness; and to
     find pleasure in those studies which may qualify me for
     extensive usefulness. We have here about three hundred
     Europeans, invalids, and officers; of the latter I see
     little, although we exchange mutual civilities: perhaps, I
     am not three hours in a week, on the average, in civilized
     society; though I might be much more if I chose, but find
     it my duty and privilege to avoid much visiting.

     ‚ÄúOne Sergeant has embraced the truth in love, I trust; and
     some others are hopeful. A native, descended from Roman
     Catholic parents, has been daily with me; and we read
     the gospel in Hindoostanee together: he is a man of good
     understanding. When I found him here (February) he had
     not seen the Scriptures: he now understands much of the
     general sense of the gospels; and eviden es a pleasing
     spirit of enquiry. I am not at present, however, without
     fears respecting his real conversion. Should it please
     God to work effectually in him, the blessing to his poor
     countrymen might prove incalculable. You will wonder,
     perhaps, that I do not speak with rapture on the subject
     of the conversion of the natives; be assured, dearest B.,
     no subject is nearer my heart; and this I feel assured of,
     that whilst health and strength remain, my life shall be
     devoted to the furtherance of this work, as well as the
     more immediate objects of my present appointment. The works
     of the devil are here manifest, and excite an abhorren e
     in my soul, which, by the grace of God, will to the last
     make me labour to destroy them: but the effects of my
     labours are not, according to human appearance, likely to
     be immediate. The rising generation seem to be the most
     likely subjects; and some favoured servant of Christ may,
     probably, lay my head in the dust, and enter on his labour
     here among ‚Äòa people prepared for the Lord.‚Äô But ‚Äòthey who
     sow and they who reap shall rejoice together‚Äô in the day of
     our Lord‚Äôs appearing.

     ‚ÄúThe superstition of this country is of such a complicated
     kind, that I can say nothing with certainty about it, at
     present. Almost every person has a different idol; or a
     different account of the same idol; and the objects of
     their worship are innumerable. A circumstance that took
     place yesterday morning, may help to shew you the folly of
     their worship: its wickedness, in some respects, cannot be
     named. The fort of Chunar (in which I live) is a fortified
     hill of about two miles in circumference; the ramparts
     command an extensive view on all sides, and most mornings
     I take a walk upon them before sun-rise. It seems, that
     the first founder of this fort and his tutor are both
     canonized, and are supposed to preside here still, and are
     worshipped as tutelar deities. Yesterday morning, at the
     south end, most remote from the guard-house, I found the
     firelock, turban, and sacred drinking-vessel of one of the
     sentinels: a brahmin was placed by the sentry-box, and was
     observed by me below. I passed on. As I returned, he spoke;
     but I did not stop. Thinking afterwards that he might be
     ill, I called a servant, and sent him to see. Now observe.
     He said that, at three in the morning, he had seen two
     figures of men approaching, that he challenged them, and
     that they immediately flew upon him, beat him unmercifully,
     and, after he was stripped, kicked him off the rampart,
     ten feet at least (the ramparts were certainly seven feet
     high). The Jemadar (a native officer) who, with others, was
     come to his assistance, was very angry with him, and said
     these figures were the identical founder of the fort and
     his tutor, who dwell in this part of the fort, and have
     thrown two sentinels over the parapet for interrupting
     them: this the brahmin before mentioned believed, and this
     opinion was current. I asked how this god came to beat him,
     a brahmin, so sacred a man? He readily answered, That the
     tutor is not a good, but a bad spirit; and they worship him
     to keep him from doing them injury. I said to some others,
     that it was quite plain that even a brahmin himself was
     not beyond the power of these demons; how then could they
     expect the brahmins to defend them? They were silent; but
     evidently not convin ed, as they offer goats in sacrifice,
     and pour out wine in libations, which they fancy the demon
     eats and drinks. I told them not to be so profuse in their
     offerings, lest Bhyzoon√°t should become so wanton as to
     destroy them all.

     ‚ÄúA rich Brahmin told me yesterday that if any one died in
     Benares, or within ten miles of it, he would undoubtedly
     go to heaven, though he were ever so great an offender. I
     told him I would come some night and plunder his house,
     and then go to Benares, and so secure both present and
     future riches. He saw my meaning, and said with a smile,
     ‚Äòthere is no need for Sahib to take any money by force;
     my wealth is all at his feet,‚Äô and so evaded my argument.
     I could fill volumes with conversations of this kind, but
     they have no more seeming effect than words spoken to the
     air; so deeply-rooted is error in their minds, and so
     congenial are their lying idols to the corrupt nature of
     man. I should not, however, forget the power of God, nor
     limit its operation. This I feel sure of, that the young,
     with means of instruction, will grow up ashamed of their
     idolatry; and means of instruction are not now entirely
     wanting. My three dear sons in the faith (young officers
     who were fellow-passengers) continue to walk in the truth.
     O, were the British all true Christians, the conversion of
     the heathen world, humanly speaking, would be comparatively
     an easy work! The appointment of Chaplain is, in this point
     of view, important.‚Äù

It will be recollected (p. 62), that a short time before Mr. Corrie
left Calcutta to proceed to Chunar, he had consulted with Mr. Brown
and other friends, as to the means by which they ‚Äúmight best promote
the glory of God in the earth,‚Äù and that among other means that were
deemed likely to contribute towards so noble an object, one was, that
each of the parties then present should forward a quarterly report of
his ministerial plans and prospects, to Mr. Brown in Calcutta; who,
having appended his own observations, should transmit a copy of the
combined reports to each individual.[36]

It was coagydered that a mutual knowledge of the facts and
observations which might be accumulated in the course of each other‚Äôs
labours and experience, would tend greatly to encourage and direct
them as individuals, amid the difficulties which the Missionary
and Chaplain had then to contend with. The first of these Reports
seems to have been made on the 6th of April 1807, but no copy of Mr.
Corrie‚Äôs communications is met with among his papers, of an earlier
date than the Report which is here subjoined.

                                           ‚ÄúChunar, July 6, 1807.

     ‚ÄúThe same routine of engagements and employments offers
     little of variety, either to amuse or profit my honoured
     brethren; but the idea of being under an engagement to
     communicate something on this day, has been no little spur
     to activity, that I might have something to relate to them.
     The motive I feel to be an unworthy one; but those among
     whom I am placed may have been benefited from it, and our
     plan will redound to their benefit at least.

     ‚ÄúMy mind has at times, been sorely exercised with
     temptations to give up all exertion in the cause of Christ,
     and take my ease like those around me; more especially,
     about a fortnight sin e, the improbability of success,
     the sneers of the world, the dread of singularity, were
     the chief engines the enemy attacked me with, respecting
     the Europeans; respecting the Heathen, his suggestions
     were chiefly, the opposition of government, the extreme
     ignoran e of the natives, the fear of commotions in the
     country, should I attempt their conversion. These, like
     fiery darts, were at different times, and in divers ways,
     cast into my soul, and grievously wounded me. I bless God,
     whose love is everlasting, that He has rebuked the tempter.
     I look back as one who has escaped shipwreck, barely with
     life; and I feel determined, through the grace of Christ,
     to count not even life dear unto myself, so that I may
     finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have
     received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the
     grace of God.

     ‚ÄúWe have had divine service regularly every Sunday morning,
     at sun-rise, in the fort. Our commanding officer has for
     some time left off attending, though he continues very
     civil and obliging. He makes ill health an excuse; although
     he has occasionally been in the fort soon after the time
     of worship, and without any cause but his own pleasure.
     Another officer has also left off attending, although
     for some time after my first arrival, he was regularly
     among us. Some others have all along been irregular in
     their attendance, and continue to come occasionally. The
     gentleman and his wife, I alluded to in my last report,
     do not go on as I had hoped, though they are very kind,
     and my only intimate associates. Although he does not
     enter into my views, he yet talks familiarly with me on
     the subject of religion, and tells me his own views and
     feelings respecting it; which, together with their regular
     attendance on public worship, made me to hope they were
     under a divine influence. But, oh, the love of this present
     evil world, is a clog which weighs down the souls even of
     those who know more of its vanity, than these [persons] at
     present do.

     ‚ÄúAmong the common men, I trust some good has been done,
     although little to lasting benefit, as yet. I mentioned a
     sergeant of Invalids, who joined himself to me soon after
     my arrival. He is now in the hospital, and seemingly in the
     last stage of sickness. He mad   profession of godliness
     in his youth, in England, it seems. He is now greatly
     alive to the coagequences of death. He is become extremely
     communicative, and in comparison of what he used to be,
     eloquent. His experience is such a lesson to backsliders,
     as makes me anxious to communicate it separately, when the
     final scene may be closed; and, therefore, I shall say
     nothing more of him here.

     ‚ÄúA Serjeant on the pension-list, has, sin e my last,
     evinced considerable concern for salvation; and is, I
     trust, in a fair way. Another Serjeant also reads, and
     assents to the books I lend him, and I am told, is somewhat
     reformed in conduct; but still is by no means a hopeful
     character.

     ‚ÄúThe native woman whom I baptized, died and was buried,
     April 12th. The man with whom she lived, is sin e married,
     having expressed great concern for his former conduct,
     and thanks for my admonitions; declaring, at the same
     time, that he never before was told he was doing wrong,
     in this respect; and that, for the fifteen years he has
     been in this country, he had not seen a clergyman, to his
     knowledge, till I arrived here. Another has put away his
     native woman; and another is now desiring to be married,
     but his commanding officer refuses to give permission, on
     the score of the woman‚Äôs character.

     ‚ÄúNo public worship as yet has been established at the
     barracks, chiefly in consequence of my health having been
     very uagettled. I am anxiously hoping to be able soon to
     have opportunity of speaking to them publicly the word of
     life. It oppresses me with grief, when I can feel as I
     ought, that many, perhaps 150, of the number of Invalids,
     seldom, or never join the public worship. The man who
     for some time has read prayers in his dwelling on Sunday
     mornings, continues to do so, being lame, and so unable
     to come up to the Fort; I fear, however, he is without
     experience of the love and grace of Christ. On Whitsunday I
     administered the Lord‚Äôs Supper to four. Thus far respecting
     the Europeans here, whom I consider myself, in a peculiar
     manner, called to attend to.

     ‚ÄúAt Secrole, which I visited last week, I found a merchant
     of real piety, though from his relating of a vision, he is,
     in my opinion, something enthusiastic. He devotes much time
     to the relief of poor and sick natives. He, for some time,
     read prayers on Sunday mornings and evenings, to the few
     artillery-men in their barracks; till, on his imprudently
     administering medicine to a sick man, he was forbidden all
     communication with them. He, however, still reads prayers
     and a sermon, in his own house, on Sundays, and some join
     him. One artillery-man, he speaks of, as a true christian.
     He had not before met with any who could understand him,
     and had frequent thoughts of writing to Mr. Brown; but
     feared that his letter would not be welcome. He is a stiff
     churchman; and when I asked him whether he had read the
     Missionary Magazine, which I saw in his shop, he started
     at the idea, and said ‚ÄòHe never had any connection with
     Dissenters.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúRespecting the heathen, I have instituted four schools for
     the instruction of children; two on each side the Fort. On
     either side, one for Hindoos, and one for Mussulmans. In
     one Hindoo school are thirty-seven: in the other thirteen.
     In one Mussulman school, are tw Ä y-two; in the other
     sixteen. In all eighty-eight children. Of thes   few
     now know their letters, and I am much exercised in mind
     respecting the introduction of the Scriptures among them.
     The Gooroos are quite avers  to any books; it has never
     been the custom, they say, for them to read books; and the
     Mahomedans have books. I trust the Lord will guide me,
     and not suffer me to mar his work by my extreme ignorance
     of the best mode of proceeding. The nearer I approach the
     work, the greater appears its difficulty, the more I feel
     my own insufficiency. If any good is done among us, how
     evidently will it appear to be of God.

     ‚ÄúNot having a copy of my last report, I know not whether
     I mentioned some native Roman Catholic Christians who
     daily attended me for reading the Scriptures. Only
     one of four continues to come, and he seems to be in
     earnest. He has with great reluctan e been brought to
     confess, that at least the purgatory of the Papists,
     their transubstantiation, and prayer to saints, have no
     foundation in Scripture. He has read the Gospels through;
     St. John twice, and we are now going through St. Matthew a
     second time. He has brought his wife and family to Chunar;
     and has expressed a wish to instruct his native brethren,
     if I will find him subsistence. After many expressions
     of this kind, I told him, that he must consider that the
     Company give no authority for this; that he must expect no
     more favour than others, from the British; that I would
     only support him with necessaries, but should expect
     his children would be taught to earn their bread; and
     desired him to reflect seriously on the subject, and make
     it matter of prayer to God. He has not expressed so much
     eagerness since this, as before. He, however, has much
     conversation with the native baptized persons; tells them
     faithfully of their sin and heathen practices; and I think
     is himself a true Christian. He yesterday explained to me
     the Parable of the Sower very exactly, without reference to
     our Lord‚Äôs explanation. It may not be amiss to transcribe
     a few remarks I have noted down respecting this man‚Äôs
     knowledge of divine truth. I understand him better than he
     understands me, but I enquire of him the meaning of what
     I have said, till I find he has caught the idea I wish to
     convey.

     ‚ÄúSaturday, May 16th. The Bettiah-walla remembered very
     exactly what I explained to him yesterday of our Lord‚Äôs
     discours  with Nicodemus; he, also, remembered very
     correctly the explanation of the allusion to the brazen
     serpent, repeating what I had told him of that transaction.
     On asking him, in what sens  must we look to Christ; he
     answered, Jesus Christ is not now on the cross: but, as He
     said to Thomas, who seeing the prints of the nails in his
     hands, cried out ‚ÄòMy Lord and my God,‚Äô--‚ÄòBlessed is he that
     hath not seen, and yet hath believed,‚Äô so it is with our
     hearts that we must look to Him; and believing that He hath
     given his blood for us, and having our hearts made clean
     by His Spirit, we shall not perish, but have everlasting
     life. He explained John iii. 17. (without being asked) very
     scripturally, and evidently with a sens  of its value.

     ‚ÄúMay 18th. In the afternoon, I had pleasure in acquiring
     the Hindoostanee. On asking the Bettiah-walla what was
     meant by the declaration, ‚ÄòNo man can come to me except the
     Father which hath sent me draw him;‚Äô he answered, ‚ÄòNo one
     desires to come to Christ unless God enlighten his mind,
     and dispos  his heart.‚Äô On asking him, What is meant by the
     expression, in John vi. 40. ‚ÄòSeeing the Son;‚Äô he replied,
     ‚ÄòSeeing Him in his word, and with our hearts.‚Äô He has
     had a conversation with a Mahomedan, who concluded with
     saying that Mahomet was the last prophet. The Bettiah-walla
     answered, ‚ÄòAccording to their own book Jesus is Noor-Ullah,
     i. e. the Son of God, that He died, and ros , and went
     up to heaven, and will come to judgment:‚Äô The Mahomedan
     consented. Bettiah-walla: ‚ÄòYour prophet is sleeping, as
     you allow; whether is greatest, a sleeping or a living
     prophet?‚Äô He allowed that the living one was the greatest,
     and promised to come again to-morrow. The Bettiah-walla
     answered to my question, ‚ÄòHow it is that if any man will
     do His will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of
     God.‚Äô (John vii. 17.) ‚ÄòThe Holy Ghost will come upon him
     and make his heart glad and holy.‚Äô‚Äù

     ‚ÄúOn one occasion I discovered him in a fault, which he
     confessed with tears, making no attempt to conceal it, and
     I believe has not fallen into it again. It was at a time I
     perceived him to be much puffed up with his attainments,
     and would gladly have made him feel the force of the
     apostle‚Äôs words, ‚ÄòLet him that thinketh &c.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúMy chief employment has been the study of Hindoostanee,
     in which however I have made but little progress, from
     frequent indisposition. My experience has in general been
     of a very painful kind. Accustomed to enjoy the communion
     of saints, and the comfort of their faith and love, I know
     but little, I perceive, how to live by faith. That passage
     has been the food of my soul for some time past. 2 Cor.
     i. 22. The name of Jesus has been refreshing ‚Äòas ointment
     poured forth;‚Äô and in this name, I doubt not finally to
     triumph.‚Äù

It may not, perhaps, be considered foreign to the purpos  of these
Memoirs to relate, that the sergeant of invalids referred to in
the foregoing Report of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs proceedings, was the son of a
dissenting minister at St. Albans, and had been religiously brought
up; but that, having cast off the fear of God, he had run a sad
career of sin and intemperance, until arrested in his cours  by the
sickness which proved fatal to him. Many short notices occur, in
Mr. Corrie‚Äôs jÄ  nal, of the sergeant‚Äôs last illness; and a fuller
account of him appeared at the time, in the Cottage Magazine. It may
suffice, therefore, to state that after the unhappy man had passed
through many alternations of terror and despair, in the fearful
expectation of a judgment to come, there was reason to believe that
h  went down to the grave in hope. Respecting the Bettiah-christian
and the Mahomedan who are noticed in the Report, some further account
occurs in a letter to the Rev. J. Buckworth.

                                               ‚ÄúAugust 2nd. 1807.

     ‚ÄúBy a letter received this day, from my sister, I learn
     the very agreeable tidings of your presentation to the
     vicarage of Dewsbury. This event takes away indeed, every
     latent hope that your lot might have been cast in India;
     but the souls of the people of Dewsbury are of equal value
     with thos  of Asia; and I earnestly pray that you may reap
     a rich harvest of souls as a reward of your labours among
     them....

     ‚ÄúBut whilst I am taken up with thos  whos  faces I have
     seen in the flesh, you are wanting to know how the work
     of the Lord prospers in India. I can only say that the
     general aspect of spiritual affairs is pleasing. Were you
     to ask particulars, I could not, perhaps, satisfactorily
     tell you why I say so; yet the progress of translation of
     the holy Scriptures, with the increased numbers of faithful
     enquirers, is surely matter of hope. I could dwell much
     on the labours of that dear servant of Christ, Martyn,
     in translating, and in exerting himself to propagate
     the knowledge of salvation among Europeans and heathen;
     but, without an intimate acquaintance with this country
     and people, much explanation would be necessary. For
     myself, the climate has so much affected me as to make the
     retrospect of my life nearly a blank: some fruit, however,
     has already appeared. Praised be He who ‚Äògiveth the
     increase!‚Äô...

     ‚ÄúThe native Christian I formerly mentioned, has renounced
     the errors of Popery, of his own accord, after a good deal
     of argument in favour of his old opinions. I believe him to
     be sincere, and that his heart is right with God. Sometimes
     he seems amused rather than grieved with the opposition of
     the Jews to our Lord; but this, though it gives me pain,
     is not so much to be wondered at, from the extreme want
     of reflection manifested by all the natives. I now allow
     him support for himself, wife, and two children. He is
     very ready in reproving and exhorting a class of people,
     descendants of the Portuguese, who are very numerous in
     India, and are nominal Christians. He warns them faithfully
     of the sin and folly of people called Christians, living as
     do the heathen; and, at my instance, he reads to them the
     Scriptures very frequently: so that I hope he may be made
     an instrument of good. By his means, also, a Mahomedan has
     been brought at least to doubt the divine commission of
     the lying prophet. This man now frequently comes to me. He
     has read the Sermon on the Mount (which I happily had by
     me, translated into Persian, by a Mr. Chambers, now dead)
     and manifests a very pleasing earnestness in search of
     truth. Nearly one hundred and twenty children are learning
     to read, at my expence: the circumstance of being able to
     read the Scriptures when put into their hands will be of
     no small advantage; as the custom of the son‚Äôs persisting
     in th  business and steps of the father, precludes the
     multitude from ever thinking the knowledge of letters
     desirable. Indeed the character in which their sacred books
     are written is not allowed to be read by any but Brahmins.
     Th  written and printed characters are the same; as they
     have had no printed books till of late; so that in learning
     they have an advantage over us, as they learn to read
     and write at the same time, first making the letter with
     chalk, or in the dust, and then pronouncing it. I have had
     much pleasure at times in exercising the proficiency of
     the children. Some of them have countenances expressive
     of every good quality: the difference of the complexion
     is forgotten under the impression that ‚Äòof one blood hath
     God made all the families of the earth.‚Äô A small present
     delights the little fellows; and they sometimes come up to
     me with smiling faces, as I pass; and make _salaam_ with
     great appearance of attachment.

     ‚ÄúI have said that appearances are pleasing: you will
     conclude that I speak comparatively. Alas! I ought to weep
     day and night at the reflection, that in this small place
     there are about 10,000, souls ‚Äòsitting in darkness and the
     shadow of death!‚Äô O that the Lord may speedily open a door
     for the entrance of Divine light among them! I am learning
     the native language as fast as my slothful nature, and
     the unsettled state of my affairs, calling me continually
     here and there, will let me. My Moonshee can now perfectly
     understand me: and when I tell him my meaning, he points
     out the proper word. In this way, besides my reading for
     instruction, I have translated the history of Joseph; and
     also to the sixth chapter of Genesis; and have got to the
     seventh of Acts. These will soon be useless, as better
     translations will be to be had; but they are of use to the
     above-mentioned native Christian for himself, and those who
     listen to his conversation; and these exercises improve
     myself. I shall begin Persian soon (D. V.) Th  Hebrew
     is a key to the Arabic; and Arabic and Persian are so
     blended with the Hindoostanee, the popular language of this
     country, that without the knowledge of Arabic and Persian,
     Hindoostanee cannot be perfectly understood.

     ‚ÄúIn order, too, to translate accurately, you know, the
     knowledge of Hebrew and Greek is necessary. You would
     be astonished at the subtilty with which the Hindoos (I
     mean learned Hindoos) argue on religious points. A rich
     man of this place one day visiting me, we entered into a
     discussion respecting one of their incarnations of the
     deity. The incarnate God, from their account, married many
     wives, had many children, &c. and when I observed that
     these things could not be the actions of God, assigning my
     reasons, &c. he readily answered, that the deity having
     taken to himself a human body, these actions were the
     actions of the man, and the godhead residing in him had
     no part in th m; that I acknowledged Messiah ate, drank,
     slept &c., which were as little the actions of God, as
     those related of Krishnoo. I answered, that the body being
     the instrument of the soul, needs refreshment to support
     it in its labours; but that the body cannot accomplish
     any of its desires without the concurrence of the spirit
     that actuates it; so that this multiplying of wives, and
     other acknowledged sinful actions, would not have been
     accomplished by Krishnoo without the animating spirit. He
     at length left me, something in anger.

     ‚ÄúI have written this at different intervals, which may
     apologize for its blots and inaccuracies: but why should I
     make apologies to you? With what inexpressible tenderness
     does the remembrance of the sweet counsel I have taken with
     you, return at times! I can now, in my mind‚Äôs eye, view
     the roads we walked together, the houses we visited, the
     companies we frequented;--the hymns we sang together, the
     petitions we joined in at the throne of grace, are many
     of them fresh in mind; and, when I am in tolerably good
     spirits, they delight me exceedingly.

     ‚ÄúBut, my general experience is of a more painful nature:
     doubts and temptations press hard upon me. The enervating
     effects of the climate make all my graces wither; and I go
     on rather in th  spirit of sullen obstinacy than under the
     influence of the constraining love of Jesus.

     ‚ÄúI hope you have written to me. Think of a solitary being,
     on the top of a hill ninety feet above the level of the
     water, without a creature near to speak a word of comfort,
     or to suggest a word of advice; and you will not think an
     hour thrown away that may support and animate his soul in
     the pursuit of ‚Äòa kingdom that cannot be moved.‚Äô‚Äù

The anniversary of the day on which Mr. Corrie arrived in Calcutta,
is marked by the following entry made in his journal,

     ‚ÄúSeptember 20th, 1807. On this day of the month last year,
     I arrived in Calcutta from England. I have determined,
     through grace, to keep new-year‚Äôs-day, my birth-day,
     days of ordination, and of my arrival in India, as days
     of examination into my state and views. On reviewing the
     memoranda connected with this day, I find great cause
     for thankfulness and praise. What I proposed, in th 
     first place, in coming to India, was the propagation of
     Christianity amongst the heathen. I had little idea of the
     difficulties attending this work; yet, blessed be God! I
     have not lost sight of it. Four schools will, I trust,
     prepare many for reading the word of life, when it is
     ready for distribution. Th  native Christian has profited
     greatly by the New Testament: he appears truly pious; and
     his desire to instruct others, whilst, I hope, it proves
     his own sincerity, will, no doubt, be beneficial to many.
     My prayers, also, have been answered as it regards this
     place. One is departed in peace: one or two others are, I
     hope, impressed; most are attentive; and favour is shewed
     me by all. I have experienced much mercy in restoration to
     health; and especially in th  restoring to me the joy of
     God‚Äôs salvation; and the Lord continues to ‚Äòdefend me with
     His favour as with a shield.‚Äô I feel in danger from the
     love of the world; yet, I hope, I shall be able to overcome
     it. I have often dedicated my all to God; and I do again
     now devote my all, especially _myself_ do I give up. I
     ought to have made greater proficiency in th  Hindoostanee;
     but I trust, through the power of Christ, to be more
     assiduous for the future.‚Äù

                             CHAPTER V.

                         RESIDENCE AT CHUNAR.


Although Mr. Corrie had been but a short time at Chunar, yet it
was evident that his ministerial labours there had begun to excite
attention both among Hindoos and Mahomedans. He had not, indeed,
acquired such a knowledge of the language of the country as satisfied
his earnest desire to make known among the heathen the glad tidings
of salvation, yet he had made progress in Hindoostanee sufficient to
enable him to hold important communications with the people of the
country. We accordingly find in his Journal and Letters more frequent
notices of his personal intercourse with the native population.

     ‚ÄúSep. 21st. An Old Brahmin came from Benares, whom Wheatly
     told me of. He knows most of our church-catechism. He told
     me that the [answers to] two questions, those respecting
     our duty towards God, and our duty towards our neighbour,
     contained the sum of all good. For a long time he had a
     very bad opinion of the English. The Mahomedans, he said,
     do abstain from _one_ kind of meat; but the English eat
     every thing. This bad opinion was confirmed by hearing a
     gentleman, whom every person praised as a good man, in a
     great rage, using many abusive expressions to a servant
     for killing a rabbit which should not have been killed.
     But when h  read the holy Scriptures, he found them pure,
     and that our practices were not consistent with them. This
     led him to ask whether I thought all the English would
     be saved? I answered, No: which startled him very much.
     ‚ÄòI greatly fear,‚Äô said he, ‚Äòon that account.‚Äô ‚ÄòIf I lose
     caste, and afterwards come short of heaven, I shall fail
     in both worlds.‚Äô This he said with tears. ‚ÄòBut,‚Äô said he,
     ‚ÄòI thought it must be so, because the tenth commandment
     says, Thou shalt not covet, &c.‚Äô and then he told me a
     story of an English collector, who took by force a little
     spot of ground that he had devoted to th  reception and
     entertainment of sick travellers, when h  would not sell
     it to him: which stumbled him greatly. Baptism, and the
     eating of meat, which, he says, disagrees with him, are
     th  rock he appears likely to split upon. I told him the
     _truth_, and pointed it out to him from the Scriptures. The
     Lord render it effectual to his salvation! I gave him a New
     Testament, at which he expressed great surprise, saying, he
     supposed it would c   several rupees; nor did he think my     reason (viz.) the love of God, in giving his Son for me,
     sufficiently constraining to induce me to _give away_ a
     thing of such value.

     ‚ÄúSep. 27th. The Brahmin came on Tuesday; and, after many
     endeavours to evade the force of God‚Äôs word, agreed, with
     much weeping, to be baptized. I have some doubt of his
     sincerity on this point. He is gone to Calcutta.

     ‚ÄúDec. 11th. Yesterday, an old Mahomedan called on me: we
     had a long conversation on religion. After some previous
     talking, he said ‚ÄòThe deity is above our comprehension; we
     are blind, and speak of Him as blind men do from handling
     an elephant; each one according to his apprehension of
     the part he handles.‚Äô I answered, ‚ÄòTrue; but if a man
     possessing sight were to behold the elephant, h  would
     describe it properly; and we might believe his report.‚Äô
     He answered, ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô ‚ÄòSuch,‚Äô I replied, ‚Äòwere the prophets
     and apostles,‚Äô &c. This led him to speak of the various
     prophets in whom, he said, we trusted. ‚ÄòOur services [said
     he] are confessedly unworthy of God, therefore there is
     need that a worthy Mediator be found, &c. one who wants
     nothing for himself, but can merit for us.‚Äô‚Äù

Agreeably to th  resolution which Mr. Corrie had formed, to observe
New-year‚Äôs-day as one of several days for self-examination, we find
him observing in his journal:

     ‚ÄúChunar, January 1st. 1808. I praise God who has brought
     me thus far in mercy; and I perceive a good monument of
     praise on the review of the past. My first desire, on
     last New-year‚Äôs-day, was to be enabled to be useful here;
     and I mark an answer to prayer in that I am heard with
     attention, and have evidently obtained some influence
     amongst the people. One, I believe, is gone home to Christ;
     whilst I trust, three others have entered on the narrow
     way. The Government yet prohibits attempts at conversion;
     and the kingdom of Christ, to outward appearance, has
     made but little progress in this land; but there is mercy
     vouchsafed sufficient to encourage me to pray; and there is
     still cause for prayer. The Bettiah-walla and two others
     have been raised up to me; with other hopeful appearances
     amongst the nativ  women. I bless God for renewed health
     of body and vigour of mind; and for somewhat of increasing
     patience and diligence in the work of the ministry. With
     respect to my resolutions, I find I have visited more than
     I wished to do; but less than I might have done, and more
     than I hope to do for the future. I praise God that I am
     not so much ashamed of the Gospel of Christ as I have been;
     and that I have been enabled to preach Jesus Christ from
     house to house, in some small degree; but, I have done far
     less than I might have done: Yet, O Lord; I ought to praise
     Thee for thy mercy: Thou hast wrought all my works in me!
     I know I am a sinner; but thy grace is sufficient for me,
     and by thy grace I am what I am. The nativ  schools have     refused books; but I hope to establish a Christian school,
     and desire that my whole life, spirit, soul, and body, may
     be occupied in the work of the Lord.‚Äù

The quarterly report transmitted by Mr. Corrie to Mr. Brown, on the
4th of January, 1808, supplies us with an outline of the progress
of religion at Chunar up to that date; and touches upon the great
practical difficulty, inseparable from that loss of the means of
subsistence, which converts from heathenism usually have to endure.

     ‚ÄúLet us begin our correspondence with erecting an Ebenezer
     to our gracious Lord, who continues us in the land of the
     living, and gives us opportunities of obtaining a great
     nearness to His blissful presence, and a more exalted
     station among those who turn many to righteousness. I might
     well, in the review of the past year, dread the imputation
     of unprofitableness, but yet I perceive it a dishonour
     to the grace of our Redeemer, to disparage the smallest
     appearance of His grace in myself, or in others; and though
     I am sure I must say, ‚ÄòLord, when saw I thee a stranger,
     &c.,‚Äô I consider it my duty to credit the precious
     declaration spoken by our great Bishop, respecting himself
     and his Œ¥ŒπŒ¨Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøŒπ, ‚ÄòThough Israel be not gathered, &c.‚Äô Is.
     xliii.

     ‚ÄúPursuing the plan suggested with so much propriety by our
     senior brother, I have to observe that since my last, some
     changes have taken place in our society, which seem upon
     the whole to have been for the better, as we have gained
     a captain of artillery, of great decorum of manners, both
     in public and private. Of our old members, I am persuaded
     that the seed of the word has put forth the ‚Äòtender blade‚Äô
     in the lady and gentleman I have before alluded to; whilst
     considerable alteration in the outward conduct of another
     gentleman is noticed; but I fear, ‚Äòone thing‚Äô at least is
     lacking in him. By four out of the six families here, I am
     asked to say grace at dinner, which when I first arrived
     was unusual. I know not what I ought to think of this,
     knowing well that in Christ, nothing availeth but ‚Äòfaith
     that worketh by love;‚Äô yet perhaps something is gained. The
     Lord help me to be more devoted to his glory, that I may
     not seem to countenance them in stopping short of the ‚Äònew
     creation!‚Äô One person is often very contemptuous towards
     me, but finds no one to join him at present. Among the
     common Europeans little but discouragement appears: only
     one seems entirely from under the dominion of outward sin.
     He is the sergeant I have mentioned, and appears a subject
     of divine grace. Several are approvers, and attendants on
     public worship, but the sad abuse of the late holy festival
     has damped my hopes respecting them.

     ‚ÄúThe first Sunday in November, having prepared a moveable
     tabernacle, it was erected at the barracks, and divine
     service has been performed there every Sunday evening
     since. On the first few occasions forty or fifty attended,
     yesterday there were about twenty-fiv . These are, for the
     most part, very attentiv , and a good deal of devotion
     appears among them in making the responses, &c. About
     six, perhaps, attend divine service twice a day. At the
     hospital one man seems piously affected, another humble
     and resigned; both these have been long ill and seem
     daily decaying. One, the first time I spoke expressly to
     him, declared with much earnestness, that h  lieved he
     had never offended his Maker; h now speaks a different
     language. One man, who was greatly alarmed during a fit of
     sickness, is, I fear, resting in a ‚Äúform of godliness,‚Äù
     though his outward conduct is decent, and he comes every
     Sunday evening to join in worship with me.

     ‚ÄúAt Benares, where I occasionally go, the pious merchant
     I have mentioned, appears much grown in ‚Äògrace and in the
     knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, &c.‚Äô He
     reads the service of the Church of England and a sermon
     from some author, twice every Sunday and every Wednesday
     evening, in a tent erected for that purpose. One Wednesday
     evening I officiated there among twenty-seven, who heard
     the word with much attention. One artillery-man of the
     lately arrived party, the merchant speaks of as hopeful.
     But I find that last week a restraint was laid upon the
     artillerymen from attending: I trust it will soon be
     removed.

     ‚ÄúAmong the Company‚Äôs servants there, one known as a
     proficient in Hindoo literature, has discovered himself
     well acquainted with evanglical principles. Another
     Company‚Äôs servant seems to me one o    jLord‚Äôs secret
     ones. I trust there is among us ‚Äòas the gleaning grapes
     when the vintage is done,‚Äô one or two.

     ‚ÄúBut what I have to say on personal experience will cast
     further light on the rligious state of our society,
     or rather, it will cast a shade on the prospect.
     Notwithstanding these agreeable particulars already
     presented, there is little farther outward acknowledgment
     of God among us; there appears as yet no disposition to
     speak and act openly as the dependent creatures and avowed
     subjects of the Most High; so that, except now and then
     in private, I cannot give vent to those felings which I
     find it my duty and happiness to cherish. On this account
     much of my rligious exercises pass without that delight in
     God which His love and mercy demand; and my experience in
     general is that of the Psalmist, when he said, ‚Äòmy heart
     breaketh for the longing &.‚Äô yet our state before God
     depends in no respect on frames and felings; and though
     miserably defective still in every point, some greater
     degree of boldness for Christ in public, and something
     of resignation to labour in his vineyard though no fruit
     should appear, I acknowledge as the work of his free
     Spirit, by whom I trust to be upheld unto the end. My
     preac  mzsince my last, has been on the following among
     other subjects, ‚ÄòGod is not a man, &c.‚Äô (Numb. xxiii. 19.)
     ‚ÄòIn this was manifested, &c.‚Äô (1 John iv. 19.) ‚ÄòHow shall
     we escape, &c.‚Äô (Heb. ii. 3.)

     ‚ÄúThe state of th nativ s hre has lately attracted much
     of my notice. From their long intercourse with Europeans,
     nativ  habits are much laid asid . They are generally
     greatly addicted to drunkenness, and are proverbially
     dissolut . They are, in consequence, very little awed by
     the European christians. I am assured that they are usually
     ready to enter into personal contest with any of the
     European invalids, who may attempt to lord it over them;
     and except from those who eat the salt of the settlement,
     none o  us have many tokens of respect paid us. In the four
     nativ  schools, there are at present seventy-fiv  scholars;
     those mentioned as reading books have left the schools from
     some cause or other, and no more books have been received.

     ‚ÄúTh nativ  women connected with the Europeans, have
     assembled on Tuesday evenings in the Fort, and on Friday
     evenings at th  arracks. The usual numbers at both places
     is from ten to sixteen. For these much of my time has been
     taken up in translations, &c. Yesterday, in the fort, a
     congregation of nineteen attended prayers in Hindoostanee.
     I used the translation our dear brother Martyn favoured
     me with, excepting a few words altered to the dialect of
     this part of the country. On these occasions th nativ 
     Christian, I before mentioned, is of the greatest service.
     He has acquired a tolerably accurate id a of the plan of
     salvation, and enlarges, with much evid nt feling, on the
     heads I suggest from the portion of Scripture before us.
     He officiates as clerk in the Hindoostanee congregation,
     and yesterday read the lessons, and explained and applied
     them as I suggested to him. The effect of his exhortations
     lasts. This man is afflicted with an asthma, which lays
     him up now and then; but the eagerness with which he
     returns to teac  mzth nativ  women, indicates, I trust,
     his heart to be right with God. Some differences took
     place in his family some time since, which disturbed me a
     good deal; but no fault has appeared in him. In a late fit
     of illness, I found he had a book o  prayers, containing
     addresses to angls, &c. Several o    jwomen have learned
     from him t  jTen Commandments, the Lord‚Äôs Prayer and the
     Creed; and it excited a gleam of holy joy yesterday to
     hear several repeating these after me, and also whispering
     some of the responses. This reminds me of a school in
     which an European teac es ten children for me, some of
     them orphans, and some who are not eligible to the school
     in Calcutta. Since the establishment of evening worship,
     one o  these children has repeated the Church catechism
     and some questions of Scripture History, with an accuracy
     rather surprising considering their years. These also join
     in the responses and insing mzth Psalms, and increase
     the ‚ÄòHosanna to the Son of David.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúTwo youths, one the son of th nativ  teac er, are on my
     premises, and read twice a day in the Hindoostanee gospel.
     One discovers no capacity whatever, nor does the word
     seem to affect him in the least. He has made considerable
     proficiency in the knowledge of the letters and reads the
     gospel without much difficulty, but can seldom at the end
     of a verse, tell the contents of it. The other discovers
     considerable quickness of apprehension, and gains knowledge
     readily; but as yet giv s no evid nce of any heart-work
     begun. Him I intend, if it please God, to appoint teac er
     of a school, in a short time. I know now of six children,
     the offspring of nativ  Christians, whom I wish him to
     instruct; two children now attend him.

     ‚ÄúO    jwomen who wre candidates for Baptism, one, it
     appears, is living insin: and on my refusing to baptize
     her till the fruits of repentance [should appear] has giv n
     up seeking instruction. The other appears very sincere;
     she comes a considerable distance, into the Fort, twice a
     week (on Tuesdays and Sundays) and is herself, as far as I
     know, o  unblemished lif . But some circumstances connected
     with her daughter, has made me defer Baptism, which seems
     to afflict her; and she promises to pursue whatever line of
     conduct I may point out. The difficulty is insuggesting
     what these people are to do for an honest livelihood. I am
     already engaged in disbursements beyond what my pecuniary
     circumstances point out as prud nt; and to tell them to
     trust in Provid nce whilst no means of subsistence appear,
     seems to savour too much of fatalism.

     ‚ÄúLet me, therefore, conclud  with proposing to the
     consideration of my brethren, The best mode of employing
     nativ  Christians who may be destitute of subsistence? And
     I think to ascertain this, it may be of service to enquire,
     What are the manufactures most engaged in at our different
     stations? And, perhaps, a barter might be established among
     themselv s, without much of our personal interference,
     if communications wre opened between them; which would
     certainly be desirable.‚Äù

In a Letter to Mr. Buckworth, written a few days later than the
preced mzReport, Mr. Corrie enters more into detail respecting his
ministry among the heathen, and the method of teac  mzemployed by
th nativ  Christian of whom m ntion has so frequently been made.

     ‚ÄúYour welcome letter of February last reached me November
     1st: and I sat down instantly to read and answr it; and
     hav  filled three sheets of paper which would have been
     sent had opportunity offered; and, from your affection for
     myself, would have amused you. I find on review, however,
     they are very unsatisfactory; and must select from them
     a moderate-sized epistle. You rightly suspected that the
     climate might affect my body, and by consequence my
     spirits also; as some of my letters to you will shew; but,
     thanks to the Lord our healer, I am as well, and have been
     for some time, as at any period in my lif . Mary had told
     me of your presentation to D; had it taken place before I
     left England, the pleasure of being a fellow-helper with
     you would probably hav  kept me there for lif ; but He who
     knows what is best for us has ordered it otherwise; and I
     am unspeakably content. At the same time, I little knew
     my own unsuitableness for the work I am engaged in; yet
     ‚Äòhitherto hath the Lord helped me:‚Äô and, though I groan
     under a sense of my shortcomings, He has not suffered me
     to go back from His sacred ways: and has, moreover, giv n
     of His Divine presence. These opportunities of writing
     call forth all my former feelings towards you; and I am
     conscious, that though so widely separated, we are one in
     the Lord Christ. But I must refrain, and giv  you some
     account of matters hre.‚Äù

After having adverted to the fears of the Indian Government lest the
animosity of th nativ s should be excited by any attempts to convert
thm to Christianity, Mr. Corrie writes:

     ‚ÄúIsuppose we should be taken to task, were we to preac 
     in the streets and highways: but other methods not less
     effectual are to be used, and less likely to produce
     popular clamour. Nativ s themselv s may and can be
     employed, with the greatest advantage, in Evangelizing
     their brethren, whilst the Minister superintends, and   î  directs and encourages. I hav  great reason to be thankful,
     that the Lord has raised up a nativ  christian, born of  ì  Roman Catholic parents, who, from March last, has been
     daily with me; and now, having acquired a sufficient
     knowledge of the way of salvation, is daily employed in
     instructing others! A despised race, whom the Europeans
     hav  attached to themselv s, hear him with great
     attention; and some with evid nt profit. He is at present
     very ill; but I trust the Lord will spare him to us, when
     more extensiv  plans will be engaged in.

     ‚ÄúAt present, there are seventy-fiv  children in my nativ 
     schools learning to read, which will tend to undermine the
     superstructure whose basis is ignorance; and I purpose
     establishing a school for [nativ ] Christian children,
     of whom I know now of six, and shall find more. The bulk
     of the people are wretchedly poor from their indolent
     habits, which never let them lay up for a rainy day.
     When a Mahomedan gets a little money, he usually spends
     it in debauchery; and a Hindoo works no more till it is
     gone. This is the character of the people: hence, beggars
     innumerable swarm; many truly wretched objects, who often
     make one retire with overflowimzey s, unable tosupply
     thm all. Of the Europeans, several are very attentive; and
     my labour is evid ntly not in vain, though I know only of  ì  one or two I can speak of with good hope. Of my three dear
     young friends, two are going on delightfully: one of these
     has lately been with a detachment against a nativ  prince
     who refused his tribute, and saw some hot work: twelv  of  ì  his brother officers fell on the occasion, but he receiv d  ì  only a slight wound in the knee: the dear lad is much grown
     in spirituality since then; and is not without trials
     of ‚Äòcruel mockings:‚Äô he writes to me once a week, and I
     endeavour, by writing constantly to him, to encourage him
     to stand fast. Away from the means of grace, and without a
     single companion like-minded, h  plainly stands by faith.
     The other at Madras goes on well, and has the ‚Äòcommunion
     of saints‚Äô to resort to. The third, a most affectionate,
     sensible youth, is, I fear, led captive; though not, I
     think, with his will. Oh! my heart yearns over thm, in
     consideration of the many, many obstacles in their way!
     The demon that oppresses Europeans in this land, ‚Äògoeth
     not out but by prayer and fasting.‚Äô Example, opportunity,
     solicitation allure thm to the paths of death; and few,
     alas, return from them! Those I allude to, are from
     eighteen to twenty or thereabouts; from which you will see
     at once the danger they are in.‚Äù

On the subject of missions Mr. Corrie adds:

     ‚ÄúTh nature of missions seems little understood, even by
     those whose hearts the Lord inclines for the work, till
     they come into it. Mr. Cecil‚Äôs sermon, before the Church
     of England Missionary society,[37] of which I hav  only
     seen extracts, is, I think, an excellent discourse on
     this subject. The work requires the patience of a Job,
     with the prudence of an Apostle: and O, the self-d nial
     required! How little I am fit for the work, my brother well
     knows; yet hre, by the good provid nce of God, I am well
     content, and determined to count not even ‚Äòlife dear‚Äô so
     that I may make ‚Äòfull proof of my ministry,‚Äô and ‚Äòfinish my
     course with joy.‚Äô I could fill sheets with conversations
     respecting religion, which I hav  had most days, with some  ì  one or other of the nativ s. Their duplicity makes it,
     beyond measure, difficult to know when they are convinced,
     or even silenced. The least appearance of impatience on
     my part makes them consider me angry; and not a word more
     will they argue, but yield every thing. I may say to you,
     th friend of my bosom, that my natural impatience is
     somewhat abated; and I am not conscious of having offended
     in this way often; but even what is the effect of eagerness
     and zeal, is construed into a passion, by a people whose  ì  highest perfection consists in restraining the feelings,
     and whose despotic governm nt rendered disguise necessary
     to existence and peace.

     ‚ÄúTh same submissive disposition in the people makes it
     difficult to know when I am understood; as they do not
     either acknowledge their ignorance or ask explanation. The
     dialects of the different provinces are so different as to
     make them nearly different languages.... Among the learned
     and the Mahomedans, much Persian and Arabic is introduced
     into their language, which to the Hindoo is unintelligible;
     and, it is now well known that a person who learns the
     language from books only, will not be understood by the
     bulk of the people. This I am aware of, and ask questions
     from the women above-mentioned; when I often find the
     meanimzhas been imperfectly, or not at all understood;
     which leads to fresh explanation. One specimen of our mode  ì  of proceedimz, I hav  made a memorandum of, and which may
     amuse you:--After having read th first chapter of Genesis,
     which I translated, I suggested to this nativ  Christian
     to enlarge upon the followimzheads, which he did in this
     manner, ‚ÄòLearn, first, the honour put upon man by God: He
     gav  him dominion.‚Äô ‚ÄòSee,‚Äô continued he, ‚Äòthe elephant;  ì  one blow of his would be instant death, yet h goes here
     and there at man‚Äôs word.‚Äô ‚ÄòObserve the power of God: He
     commanded, and it was done, &c.‚Äô ‚ÄòLet a man try to create
     an ant, he cannot do it; let him try to make a hair, he
     cannot do it: yet look at the hills, &c., God made thm;
     and think not that He used labour: no, the word of His
     mouth was sufficient.‚Äô I suggested, ‚ÄòHow ought we thn to
     fear this great God!‚Äô He proceeded, ‚Äòare you not afraid
     of your masters; are you not fearful to offend thm lest
     they should punish you?‚Äô This was so feeling an appeal that
     they answered, ‚ÄòYes, yes!‚Äô ‚ÄòO thn,‚Äô said he ‚Äòhow ought
     you to fear an infinitely powerful God! He is infinite
     in strength; and, if you sin against Him, you deserve
     infinite punishment: and think how great punishment He will
     inflict!‚Äô One of thm at this fell a weeping. I observed,
     ‚ÄòSee the goodness of God in providing such comforts and
     accommodation for man in this world.‚Äô He went on to speak
     of the greater love of God in providing a salvation
     for our souls, which he spoke of with much warmth; the
     women hanging upon his words. These occasions are often
     productive of sweet sensations to my soul: whilst yet the
     want of positive evid nce of grace in them [the people so
     instructed] generally makes me to go heavily ì ost days
     are devoted to close study of the nativ  languages: the
     Hindoostanee proper I can understand, though not to speak
     it with any fluency or accuracy: and I also begin to know a
     little Persian, which is a very agreeable study. I rise at
     day-break, breakfast between seven and eight, take a slight
     repast about one, and make my principal meal when evening
     sets in. Then my mind is usually too exhausted for study,
     and sweet would be th society of some with whom I could
     talk freely of what Christ did, and said, and suffered for
     us here below. For the want of such society, very little
     of the liv ly feeling I enjoyed in England enters into
     my experience: yet I am conscious of some more boldness
     for Christ, and fewer deviations from His holy ways than
     before; for which I adore His free grace by which alone I
     stand. These expressions I owe to your affection, who will
     fear, perhaps, for me; lest by any means the tempter gain
     the better of me. O, that I could say this were never the
     case! Yet, though I should justly be deemed a fool for thus
     boasting to others, yet I may call upon you to rejoice with
     me that I hav  obtained help from the Lord thus far, and
     hav  a hope that I shall never be ashamed.

     ‚ÄúFrom all that has passed, I see further proof that to
     preach nearly or quite Christianity, and liv  as the world
     lives, is the way to popularity: to liv  and preach so as
     to fancy to _recommend_ Christianity to the carnal mind,
     is the way to be little esteemed: to liv  godly in Christ
     Jesus is the way to win souls, and to obtain friends,
     with persecution here, and with the certain expectation
     of glory hereafter. O Holy Ghost, write these truths with
     deep conviction on my mind; and let my soul know nothimzon
     earth but Jesus Christ and him crucified!‚Äù

When it is considered that the labours of a nativ  Teacher cannot
but be of great importance, even in the most effective state of
Missionary arrangements, it will not excite surprise that in
Mr. Corrie‚Äôs circumstances at Chunar, th illness of th Bettiah
Christian should occasion him anxiety. Mr. C‚Äôs journal, however,
affords pleasing evid nce that the Bettiah-walla in his sickness,
found consolation in that gospel which he seems to hav  been
earnestly desirous of makimzknown to his countrymen.

     ‚ÄúJan. 7th. I sent off to-day a copy of the Gospels, and of
     the Morning Prayer, and Tn Commandments, to Bettiah, at
     th request of a person who is said to be th Sirdar[38]
     of the Christians there, and of whom even the padras stand
     in awe: he is represented, also, as understanding Persian,
     Portuguese, and a little Latin. I dined with Captain
     M----; after sitting silent for some time, I was induced
     by som remarks of Major General ----, to enter into a
     long argument in behalf of Christianity, as the General
     maintained Mahomedanism to be equal to Christianity: the
     argument arose from my remarking that I thought men would
     invariably be guid d in their conduct respecting temporal
     affairs by their religious opinions. ‚ÄòThis,‚Äô he said,
     ‚Äòwas a great mistake, and had led to the most disastrous
     effects: that no greater misfortunes had come on mankimd
     than the contentions between Christians on religious
     pret nces.‚Äô I answered, that these were not caused by
     Christianity; and Gibbon himself being judge, Christianity
     was only the pret xt: and on a comparison between
     Christianity and Mahomedanism, I was enabled so to speak as
     to leave him without reply 

     ‚ÄúJan. 11th. Yesterday, the Bettiah-walla was seized with
     fever. I asked him how he was, as it regard d spiritual
     thimzs: he said, ‚ÄòHappy.‚Äô To-day he is worse: but, in
     answer to my question, he told me, ‚Äòthat he was not afraid
     of death, but of sin.‚Äô In the evening I took Mr. G. to
     see him, who kindly offered his services. We found him
     in danger: he told me that ‚Äòhis mind was fixed on Christ
     Jesus: who could do all thimzs.‚Äô ‚ÄòI am,‚Äô said he, ‚Äòin His
     hands;‚Äô and, in answer to my question, he told me ‚Äòhe found
     comfort.‚Äô I hav  prayed that the Lord will spare him; and I
     trust he will be continued to the Church here 

     ‚ÄúJan. 17th. The Bettiah-walla better: but very low: he
     speaks of every event as proceeding from the mercy of
     Jesus. After having spoken to him of the Redeemer, I asked
     him if he remembered Christ‚Äôs words, (John iv. 13, 14.) ‚Äòhe
     that drinketh, &c.‚Äô he took up the words and finished the
     passage, adding, with a significant expression, ‚ÄòHow can I
     forget Him?‚Äô And many other declarations were add d of His
     grace and greatness.

     ‚ÄúJan. 18th. Twenty-two women attend d, and heard the
     history of Ishmael, with much attention. The Bettiah-walla,
     speakimzof the trouble occasioned to Abraham and Sarah,
     by the strife which arose from their sin in the matter of
     Hagar, spoke so feebly, yet with such affection, of th
     love of Christ, through whom they receiv d forgiveness, and
     through whom we too must seek forgiveness, that most of
     them wept. I could scarcely contain myself for joy. O Lord,
     make thy word effectual!

     ‚ÄúA Tickour woman [who was desirous of baptism] in answer to
     my questions, and without any suggestion that could lead
     to such answers, said, ‚Äòthat her heart is much employed in
     thimkimzof her Creator: if it were not, what could she
     expect of good either here or hereafter.‚Äô 2ndly, ‚Äòthat God
     as Creator and Lord has a right to command us; and that
     she is disposed to obey His will in all thimzs.‚Äô 3rdly,
     ‚Äòthat Jesus Christ is God, who came into the world for
     us sinners, and through whom we may obtain forgiveness,
     and the favour of God.‚Äô 4thly, ‚Äòthat in order to this, we
     must lay hold of Him with th heart, pray to Him, and beg
     forgiveness.‚Äô 5thly, ‚Äòthat to be baptiz d, and not to act
     thus, must needs brings down greater evils upon us; and
     in the world to come, surely great destruction will be our
     lot, &c.:‚Äô with much more to the same effect, in a spirit
     of seeming sincerity and earnestness.

     ‚ÄúJan. 31st. 1808. On Friday evening, thirteen women
     (native) attend d at the barracks. Sergeant W. told me that
     his native wife, a short time since, entered into a long
     conversation with a Brahmin, and exhorted him to forsake
     his idolatry, which he acknowledged to be unreasonable; but
     the loss of caste frightens him 

     ‚ÄúSaturday, [Feb. 6.] Just return d from burying a drummer‚Äôs
     wife. The Bettiah-walla explained that I was not praying
     for the dead, but that we might have grace to walk in God‚Äôs
     ways. He told them, that when the breath is gone, the soul
     is fixed in an et rnal state; and that in the last day,
     the body too will be raised and partake with th soul of
     happiness or misery: [he conclud d] with an exhortation (in
     which he mixed many quotations from scripture) to watch and
     pray that that day might not come upon them unawares. Many
     natives were present, who listened with deep attention;
     except one or two who laughed. At my gate I found a blind
     beggar, whom the Bettiah-walla also exhorted and who went
     away; as I hav  often seen the poor glad to get a rupee and
     to be off 

     ‚ÄúFeby. 10th. This morning a Brahmin came to me, who
     declared ‚Äòthat the Sanscrit language is not the invention
     of man, but came from Maha Deva‚Äôs[39] B√†ni: that four
     genii, who remain about the size of children of eight
     years of age, hearing the sound of the drum, repeated the
     sounds, from whence, having written them, they collected
     the twenty-five letters of the alphabet. On my askimzhim,
     how so many letters could be collected from one sound;
     after some dispute he said, ‚ÄòMaha Deva‚Äôs B√†ni was not like
     to any now in siz , but at the day of judgment it will
     sound again, and strike all with horror.‚Äô I then inquired,
     who committed this language to writing in the Shasters?
     He answered, ‚Äòthree Fakeers, to whom the four genii
     communicated it.‚Äô On askimzwhere they liv d, he mentioned
     ‚Äòa jungle near th hill:‚Äô on askimzwhere the hill was,
     he could not tell; and, after a long argument, went away
     promising to bring a map, and shew me the situation of th
     hill; ‚Äòwhich, however, is beyond the snowy mountains, in
     the land of the genii.‚Äô To this I objected, that as the
     Shasters confined the residence of the Hindoos to this
     country, the religious men would never call their own place
     of residence unholy; and, therefore, it must be in this
     land. We parted with th promiseof his coming again.

     ‚ÄúFeb. 12th. Yesterday, the Brahmin came again; and, after
     much conversation said, ‚Äòthere is no difference in places;
     and that only the ignorant worship stones, &c., but the
     fear of popular displeasure keeps them silent.‚Äô In the
     evening, he came again, and we had a sharp dispute, chiefly
     on the distance of places: his Shasters describe Hindoostan
     as seventy-five millions of miles long. My moonshee and the
     Brahmin had a warm argument.

     ‚ÄúFeb. 21st. The Tickour woman gave notice that sh had
     found sponsors. On callimzher, I asked her if it was the
     intention of her heart to be the slav  of Jesus Christ; to
     which she replied in the affirmative, with great fervency,
     saying, ‚Äòthat it was her desire to walk in His paths
     always.‚Äô I reminded her of what I had been reading in John
     xiv., ‚ÄòHe that hath my commandments, and keepeth thm,
     he it is that loveth me;‚Äô to which she answered, ‚Äòthat
     her desire was to obey His will; that it may be well with
     her both in this life, and the next.‚Äô She then used some
     expressions of admiration at the grace of God to sinners;
     and on my saying, that when the Bettiah-walla return d, I
     would appoint a day for baptism, she fell on the ground
     at my feet in tears, puttimzher hand on my shoes, and
     raised her hand to her forehead. On being asked [a few
     days afterwards] ‚Äòwhy sh so earn stly desired baptism;‚Äô
     she said, ‚Äòthat sh might be directed in the right way;
     obtain pardon of sins and receive God‚Äôs mercy; both in
     this world and that which is to come.‚Äô She then entered
     on a long history of her life, told me that her husband
     died and left her in poverty, that sh went about begging,
     till her daughter was married, who, after much ill usage,
     was at length left destitute; and now, to her grief, is
     connected with P. ‚ÄòIt was of no use,‚Äô she said, ‚Äòto walk in
     God‚Äôs laws, and in this way, for three or four days; or,
     in attempting to deceive me, for that God knows her heart;
     and should she attempt to deceive me, God would punish her
     both in this world, and the next.‚Äô I left her, desirimzher
     to consider whether she would cause her daughter to take
     a separate house; which is evidently a trial toher, and
     which will, in good earn st, prove her sincerity, if she
     does.‚Äù

The first anniversary of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs ministerial connexion with
Chunar is thus commemorated in his Journal:

     ‚ÄúIt is a year to-day [Feb. 22.] since I commenced my public
     duty at Chunar; and, on considering the way in which the
     Lord hath led me during that period, I find great cause
     for thankfulness that I have not laboured in vain: some
     doors of usefulness have been open d, and some good has
     been done. Many amongst the invalids are altered for the
     better in their conduct; several of them have married,
     and two artillery-men, I would fain hope, are serious and
     impressed. Amongst the Hindoos, some, I trust, have been
     brought to the knowledge of Jesus Christ; yet, I think,
     I am not so spiritually-minded as I was before I left
     England: though, I think, I am more constantly fix d, and
     more undeviatingly aiming, at the end of my ministry; yet I
     fear that the warmth of spiritual affection is gone; but I
     will ‚Äòdo again my first works.‚Äô O thou whom my soul loveth,
     grant me that ‚Äògold, white raiment, and aye salve,‚Äô which
     thou hast in store for needy creatures; heal me for thy
     mercies‚Äô sake!‚Äù

It has been already stated that the Europeans at Secrole were
regarded by Mr. Corrie as part of his ministerial charge; but as
Secrole was a kind of suburb to Benares, he was necessarily brought
into contact with th Hindoos resident in and about that ‚Äòvery
citadel of Idolatry.‚Äô Hitherto, however, it does not appear that any
opportunity had occurred to Mr. C. for seeing much of the native
city. Under date, therefore, of March 2, 1808, he writes:

     ‚ÄúY sterday morning, desirimzto see Benares, I went down
     the Ganges in a small boat; but was greatly disappointed
     at the appearance of the city, which stands entirely on
     the w st side of the river. One place, the residence of
     Badshahzada, has the appearance of ruin d magnificence;
     and several ghauts are extensive and laboured monuments
     of superstition: but the smallness of dimensions of the
     buildings around makes them appear nothing, to an European.
     Amidst them all, I came to the British flag, flying at the
     Ghaut Mangees stairs, w ì  excited grateful sensations.
     Idolatry is plainly on the decay. Our boat lin  getting
     entangled with another boat, much abuse was bestowed on the
     Feringhee.‚Äù

Mr. Corrie relates, that on this occasion he preached to some
natives of Benares, as well as gave instruction to the European
soldiery. Three weeks later than this visit he was called upon to
baptize a Brahmin, who after many strugglings of conscience had been
strengthen d by the grace of God to ‚Äòconfess the faith of Christ
crucified.‚Äô An account of this event is given by Mr. C. in a letter
to his father, dated March 25, 1808.[40]

     ‚ÄúI have to tell you of the baptism of a Brahmin at Benares,
     on Wedn sday last, when I was down there, which will
     gratify you much. You must remember that he understands
     enough of English for common purposes; and most of our
     conversation was in English. He came to me in September
     last, as I wrote to some of you; he had before been
     seeking after truth; and a pious merchant at Benares had
     given him a Book of Common Prayer: this was the chief
     instrument in his conversion. The two answers respecting
     ‚Äòour duty towards God and our duty towards our neighbour‚Äô
     struck him forcibly; and he learn d many of the prayers,
     and much of the catechism by heart. He was, however,
     greatly averse to baptism in September, and argued that
     he could serve God in private, and even promote His
     cause more, whilst he refrained from the open profession
     of Christianity. I pointed out from Mark xvi. 16, and
     John iii. the necessity of attendimzto ‚Äòthe outward and
     visible sign, as well as the inward and spiritual grace,‚Äô
     if we would ‚Äòmake our calling and election sure.‚Äô He
     left me with tears, acknowledging that I spoke truth;
     but absented himself until January last, when he again
     went to the pious merchant, saying he had been very ill,
     and now found that none but Jesus Christ could save him:
     he would, therefore, give up all for Christ. After much
     intercourse, on Tu sday last I asked him, ‚ÄòAre you willing
     to be baptized?‚Äô Answer, ‚ÄòYes, I have no other Lord, no
     other Saviour, but Jesus Christ: He is God, and my God.‚Äô
     What makes you think Him God? Answer,--‚ÄòWhy, Sahib, I don‚Äôt
     know how many times I may have been in the world before,
     or whether born at all, or not, before this time; but I
     have continued a great sinner still, (th Hindoos believe
     in the metempsychosis,) a very great sinner, I believe: I
     went to Juggernaut and here to Benares, and here and there
     (mentioning other places) to poojah (worship;) but I was
     still very bad, Sahib, very great sinner. When I found no
     good among Hindoos‚Äô worship, I went to Musselmans,‚Äô to
     Lucknow, (mentioning a great mahomedan doctor there,) to
     enquire; but found no good in Musselmans‚Äô religion; but
     all bad, very bad. Then I met with th ten commandments,
     and these two, my duty towards God, and my duty towards
     my neighbour: this my heart say good, very good: this is
     Jesus Christ‚Äôs word, and I pray to Him for His grace, and
     H  gave me understanding: now I know the true God; my
     heart love His word; and I no more love sin, or bad way;
     therefore, I know Jesus Christ is God,‚Äô with more to the
     same effect. (You will perceive that if men set themselves
     to seek Christ in this way, we should have no Arians or
     Socinians.) I then asked, What do you think will be after
     death? Answer, ‚ÄòI shall go to God; what else, Sahib? Now
     H  has given me grace, I am all light within: will He put
     light with darkness again? No, I shall go to God after
     death.‚Äô Will you forsake your family and friends? Answer,
     ‚ÄòMy father, Sahib, very old: he wash in Ganges, and make
     poojah: I cannot help him, but I will love him, I will
     honour him, as Jesus Christ‚Äôs word is: O! I cannot help
     him, but I will make prayer for him: I must follow my Lord
     Christ; there is no Saviour but He: Hindoos, Musselmans,
     all worship devils,‚Äô with more to that effect--addimz
     ‚ÄòEver since I was with you, Sahib, my heart was full, and
     now, if you please, I will be baptized.‚Äô After prayer, we
     separated: next day when he came to me, I asked him, ‚ÄòHave
     you thought much of the matter, and are you willing to
     forsake all for Christ?‚Äô He answered, ‚ÄòI have made much
     prayer to God for His grace; and now I will forsake all for
     my Lord Christ: you will pray, Sahib, that He will wash
     me, and make me clean: you will mention before Him for the
     old sinner, a very great sinner, an old rogue, very bad,
     very bad sinner; that He will save me, and give me grace,
     that I may love Him with all my heart. I cannot keep His
     commandments without his grace; but I will pray always, and
     love Him, and cleave to Him (laying hold of his own garment
     with eagerness;) and, I will always speak truth, and take
     care of my words.‚Äô All this with th expressive action of
     the natives, who have more action than even the French in
     conversation. At the time of administering the sacrament
     of baptism, he made the responses from the Book of Common
     Prayer, with much feeling: when addressed in the service,
     he shewed the most lively attention, and was very earnest
     in the prayers: after the service, he shook hands with all
     present, expressed with tears his thankfulness to God for
     his mercy to so great a sinner; and said he would serve Him
     for ever, and devote all his time to learning His word more
     perfectly that he might instruct others.‚Äù

Although there was much to comfort and encourage Mr. Corrie in this
manifest example of the power of divine grace, in the conversion of
this Brahmin; yet by an entry in his journal, dated March 31st, we
find him complaining:--

     ‚ÄúI have for several days laboured under sad spiritual
     decay; and have been dreadfully oppressed with the fear of
     man; and very backward to every good word and work. When
     the Brahmin consented to be baptized on Tuesday, th enemy
     raised an alarm in my mind respecting what th effect might
     be; tumults among the natives; anger on the part of the
     Europeans; removal by the government: these suggestions
     greatly distracted me: and I got me to my Lord right
     humbly, who mercifully delivered me from all these fears;
     and all these difficulties vanished; yet, at the time, I
     felt none of that joy or gratitude I ought, on account of
     the triumph of the cross.‚Äù

Th Journal proceeds:

     ‚ÄúApril 10th, 1808. To-day I am thirty-one years of age. I
     praise God that I am in th land of prayer; I have been
     praying for a right spirit of self-examination. It strikes
     me as remarkable in my experience, that although I could
     be always on my knees, I am usually straitened, perplexed,
     and confused in prayer: wandering thoughts perplex me
     beyond measure; and my imagination is wild and troubled,
     yet without order, even in vainly flying from one scene to
     another, and musing on the greatest improbabilities. My
     mind is, through grace, settled and grounded in the ways
     of Christ; and, I am persuaded that I shall never leave
     the heavenly way, because the Lord will keep me in fear
     of forsaking it. I have no enjoyment in worldly company,
     or amusements; otherwise, I have nothing of _assurance_,
     as I have understood it: and though I consent to every
     tittle stated in our 17th Article, it works nothing of
     ‚Äòunclean living or presumption.‚Äô It does, however, preserve
     me from despair; for, I never should be delivered but by
     the Spirit of Christ: nor, could I hope that His gracious
     influence would be granted to my prayers, were it not
     for the unconditional, covenanted, love of God in Christ
     Jesus. I have many short, but sweet, visits of heavenly
     grace. My soul is frequently melted down in praise, for
     the Divine condescension towards me; but little of abiding
     joy, or realizing faith, stays with me. I find ‚Äòthe work
     of righteousness‚Äô to be ‚Äòpeace.‚Äô More of my time has been
     employed for God, than I could once have thought possible
     to give; yet few days pass that my soul is not overwhelmed
     with a sense of short-coming: hence, Thou, O Christ, art
     all I want!

     ‚ÄúWe have had some slight awakenings here (Chunar) during
     the past year: one in August; but it is, I fear, come
     to nothing, except H. who may have found mercy of the
     Lord: th others have turned backward, and ----, died in
     consequence of intoxication. At present a greater enquiry
     is excited than ever: three are come out (from the world)
     and several are anxiously concerned. ‚ÄòThe Lord knoweth thm
     that are His.‚Äô Now, my soul, look to it lest thou let any
     of those things ‚Äòslip‚Äô which thou hast heard and learned
     of Jesus. O, for a spirit of grace and supplication: for
     ‚Äògood understanding in the ways of godliness.‚Äô O, for
     the conversion of souls! Lord, hear me in these matters:
     prosper thy work; let thine own kingdom come. Bless my
     country, my family, my friends: and, O, accept a poor worm
     who offers himself unto Thee. Take me, as thy dear-bought
     purchase; and secure me unto thyself. Let my life bring
     glory to thy name; and my death bear testimony to Thy
     faithfulness and truth: let m live, and die to Christ
     Jesus, Amen!

     ‚ÄúIn the afternoon, I baptized the Tickour woman, by the
     name of ‚ÄòMary.‚Äô Satan continues to mar my comfort; though
     he cannot, through the grace of Christ, prevent the word of
     God. When I baptized the Brahmin, he raised in my mind such
     a fear of the anger of those in power as almost drove me
     to my wits‚Äô end: but now I see that all was over-ruled for
     good, in order to prevent my overweening conceit of myself
     in this matter.‚Äù

It will have been observed, that Mr. Corrie not unfrequently
complained of th loss of health. The cause might no doubt be traced
to his want of due regard to the trying nature of the climate of
India to an European constitution. Repeated notices occur, therefore,
in Mr. C.‚Äôs Journal and Letters, of a languor and general debility
which threatened to lay him altogether aside from duty, if not to
render it necessary for him to quit the country. At this time,
however, a material change for the better seems to have taken place
in his health; for in writing to his father under date of April, 20,
1808. Mr. C. remarks,

     ‚ÄúA gracious Providence who has followed us with goodness
     and mercy all our days, has prospered me thus far. You
     will bless God with me, who upholds me in perfect health
     ... a most surprising change seems to have passed upon my
     constitution, so that I feel very little inconvenience
     from the heat. Last year I was obliged to have recourse
     to medicine to keep me from fainting; now, though the
     hot winds have been blowing some weeks, I feel active
     and cheerful as when with you. A sigh of regret at our
     separation often, indeed, interrupts my joys, and sends
     me with tears not unfrequently to your Father and my
     Father, to your God and my God. O, praise to a precious
     Redeemer, through whose love and grace so lasting an union
     has been brought about, which swallows up even natural
     ties, or rather rivets them by an indissoluble bond! All
     painful idea of separation and distance is lost in the
     consideration of that better country, where we shall meet
     to part no more for ever!

     ‚ÄúYou will rejoice to hear that the word of God is
     not without increasing witness among the soldiers.
     Eighteen attended the sacrament of the Lord‚Äôs supper
     on Easter-day, most of whom are serious and attentive;
     and many are regular at our evening worship, where
     they attend voluntarily. Among their wives also great
     attention continues to be paid; and knowledge, at least,
     is increased. The Brahmin whom I baptized came up (from
     Benares) last Sunday; and after attending worship in
     Hindoostanee, expressed much delight. He proposed, as
     a doubt, what would once have been an article of faith
     with him:--‚ÄòSahib, you have been so little while in this
     country, and [yet] know th language so well, I think you
     must have been a Hindoo before you were born in England,
     and, therefore, your fresh language came to you so quick
     again.‚Äô A fortnight since, I baptized a woman, who is
     evidently seeking sincerely the kingdom of God. Yesterday,
     she expressed her gratitude for instruction, by saying,
     ‚ÄòI am a poor woman, and have nothing to offer to Sahib in
     return for his favour, except three fowls which I shall
     send to-morrow, if he will please to accept them.‚Äô On
     my saying, God has given me plenty, she said, ‚ÄòTrue,‚Äô
     but it is my duty to lay my neck beneath Sahib‚Äôs feet.‚Äô
     Th language of the common people is, indeed, full of
     compliment; but none of them show a disposition to give
     any thing away, except in some instances where grace seems
     to open their hearts. Another, the wife of an European,
     who seems the best Christian of them all, on my noticing a
     little dog, sent it to m next day, begging my acceptance
     of it. To excuse myself, I said it was too young, and she
     is now keeping it for my sister, and takes great pains in
     teaching it to beg, &c. that my sister may be amused with
     it when she arrives.‚Äù


                      TO THE REV. J. BUCKWORTH.

                                                 ‚ÄúApril 25, 1808.

     ‚ÄúThe heat of the climate induces a despondency entirely
     unknown to you. I perceive plainly that this despondency
     not a little infected my mind most of th last hot weather;
     which was, perhaps, increased by continued ill health. I
     have been enabled, however, to hold fast my integrity; nor
     ever have handled the word of God deceitfully; nor has the
     word been without witness. A great increase is now made
     to my evening congregations, which are my only joy, they
     coming voluntarily; and on Wednesday next, I begin a weekly
     lecture.... I am, through mercy, now in perfect health,
     and usual spirits; and see it ‚Äògood for me to have been in
     trouble.‚Äô My present mode of passing my time will give you,
     perhaps, pleasure, certainly amusement. On an average I do
     not dine from home above once a week, and seldom see any of
     my equals here, except a family, who, I hope, are pious,
     though their progress is slow. From morning (five o‚Äôclock
     till eight) I attend to my own private affairs, with a
     little exercise: then till three or four, learn the native
     languages; when every day, either some of the natives come
     to me to read the Scriptures, or I attend some place of
     meeting for that purpose. Mr. Martyn writes to me weekly:
     he is preparing a copy of the gospels in Hindoostanee for
     the press; this will be an invaluable acquisition: the
     one we have is so learned as to be unintelligible to the
     vulgar for the most part. I have altered [the version of]
     St. John‚Äôs Gospel which we use. The Acts of the Apostles
     especially delight the native teacher: I have told you of
     ----; you would be surprised to see the effect it has upon
     him; and the eagerness by which it is heard by others.
     I feel it to be too little regarded by myself, and am
     too apt to consider the divine manna a common thing. I
     send my father by these ships the history of a Brahmin‚Äôs
     conversion, whom I lately baptised.[41] I baptized a woman
     a fortnight since; and several of the soldiers‚Äô native
     wives. Sinners are plainly under good impressions; but, Oh!
     the patience and perseverance necessary to deal with them!

     ‚ÄúDr. Buchanan is on his way home: whatever he may publish
     will give you a true and clear insight into religious
     affairs here; except that you can have no idea of the
     magnitude of the work of conversion, unless you were here.‚Äù

In the Journal, Mr. Corrie relates

     ‚ÄúMay 14th. Yesterday morning, I went to Wheatley‚Äôs
     hospital. The Dhobee[42] only seems truly in earnest: he
     said that since he first heard the word, his heart had been
     much taken with it; that the more he hears it, the more he
     esteems it; and that he is happy in it. ‚ÄòJesus Christ,‚Äô he
     says, ‚Äòis the creator and preserver of all things, who will
     take him to God‚Äôs presence; or if not, His will be done:
     yet he will serve Him; and has forsaken Satan‚Äôs works, and
     will return to them no more. Satan‚Äôs works are worshipping
     stones, poojah, &c. &c.‚Äô Here one of the bystanders said,
     ‚ÄòSatan‚Äôs works are also lying, stealing, &c. &c.‚Äô To-night
     Anselmo[43] is ill. On my speaking to him, he said,
     ‚ÄòWhether well or ill, I am always begging for pardon of sin
     from Jesus Christ: I am not deserving of it, but am worthy
     of hell; yet, as He died for sinners, God for His sake will
     hear me: this is my constant hope; but now, indeed, I need
     more grace and support.‚Äô--Praise God for these things. O
     for patience and perseverance in the Lord‚Äôs work!

     ‚ÄúSECROLE. July 25th. According to leave obtained, and
     notice given, I came down on Friday evening with the view
     to perform divine service yesterday. On Saturday morning,
     I waited on the general, who received me with the most
     chilling coolness. He told me that he had nothing to do
     with divine service, or tis artillery-men; and that he
     should not interfere: he had heard nothing of divine
     service, except from my application. Mr. ----, who had been
     forward for my coming down, on hearing of my arrival flew
     quite off, and said, ‚Äòthey could do as well now as before,
     without divine service,‚Äô he, however, came yesterday
     morning. A congregation of at least sixty assembled; and
     after service, Mr. A. thanked me, and said he hoped they
     should give me encouragement to come amongst them oftener.
     Afterwards, the Brigade Major came with a message from
     the general, (who did not come to church) saying, that
     I was ‚Äòat liberty to come and go as I pleased, but the
     artillery-men and officers could not be permitted to attend
     so far from the lines, for fear of the natives seizing the
     guns whilst they were at a distance: if the court-house
     were used to assemble in, or a place of worship erected
     near the lines, he should have no objection; but all
     this was to be kept a secret.‚Äô Well: blessed be God, who
     hath opened a door here for His word! Had there been no
     obstacles thrown in the way, it would have been unusual.
     Satan never yet freely and without a struggle, resigned
     his dominion. O Lord, I have no might or skill to resist
     this great enemy; neither know I what to do; but mine eyes
     are towards thee! In the morning service, I was sadly
     amazed by the presence of so many of the great ones of the
     earth; but after the service commenced, these feelings
     vanished.

     ‚ÄúAug. 24th. On Monday I went to Mirzapore, where I saw an
     old Fakeer, the most wretched victim of superstition I have
     met with. He has been a great traveller, and by the strange
     noises he utters, and the inhuman appearance he puts on,
     causes the people to take him for some great one. He struck
     me as strongly under Satanic influence. I endeavoured
     to gain from him some idea of his creed; but could not.
     Narsingha, who is celebrated in the Bhagavat Geeta,[44] is
     his titular deity, whom he considers equal to the other
     gods. I am confounded at the thought that, from the conduct
     of the English present, I was prevented warning him as I
     ought of his danger.

     ‚ÄúAug. 31st. Yesterday was spent at Ghazeepore; much talk
     about religion, and religious people; but little religious
     conversation. In prayer, I have been sometimes enabled to
     make my ‚Äòrequests known with thanksgiving;‚Äô but have felt
     great backwardness to the public services of the Church.
     ‚ÄòLord, be merciful to me a sinner!‚Äô for that I suffered the
     rain to prevent me from going to the evening worship; and
     that when I have spoken unto the men, it has been in a cold
     and indifferent manner! I see in Robinson[45] of Cambridge
     (whose life I read yesterday) how far a person, and even a
     minister of religion may go, and yet be as ‚Äòsounding brass
     or a tinkling symbol.‚Äô‚Äù

                             CHAPTER VI.

              VISIT TO CALCUTTA--ARRIVAL OF HIS SISTER.


In the beginning of September 1808, Mr. Corrie left Chunar, for
the purpose of meeting his sister at Calcutta on her expected
arrival from England; and on his way thither he spent some weeks
with Mr. Martyn, at Dinapore. Several foreboding expressions occur
in Mr. Corrie‚Äôs Journal respecting the possible termination of the
unsatisfactory state of health in which he found Mr. Martyn. With
the purpose, therefore, of relieving that excellent person from the
pressure of clerical duty, Mr. C. remained longer at Dinapore than he
had at first intended. Of Mr. Martyn, also, he writes,

     ‚ÄúHe entertains the opinion that he shall die before long;
     and desired me to tell Mr. Brown that should he die before
     my return, he trusted he is in the Lord, and happy. He
     wishes, if it please God, to be spared on account of the
     translations, but with great earnestness he said, ‚ÄòI wish
     to have my whole soul swallowed up in the will of God.‚Äô
     He then observed, ‚ÄòWhen I look back, I see nothing that
     affords me satisfaction: all my consolation flows from the
     free grace that is in Christ Jesus:--that grace which is
     now offered to-day, this is alone what comforts my soul.‚Äô‚Äù

Considering the brotherly affection that subsisted between the two
friends, it cannot be a matter of surprise, that when, under these
circumstances, the time for parting approached, Mr. C. should have
experienced some depression of spirits.

     ‚ÄúThis morning,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúwas a mournful time with me.
     I could scarcely express myself from the acuteness of my
     feelings, but tried to suppress them. I have no idea,
     however, but that I shall meet him again, if I am spared to
     return; but O! let me not boast of to-morrow, but learn to
     die daily.‚Äù

When Mr. Corrie reached Calcutta, his joy on meeting a beloved sister
was somewhat modified by the intelligence which she brought that one
of his letters[46] had been printed in an English periodical. The
distress and alarm which this circumstance occasioned Mr. Corrie will
be readily accounted for, when it is recollected that a violent dread
of Missionary operations in India, had at that time taken possession
of the minds of many influential persons, and that a motion had even
been submitted to the Court of East India proprietors for expelling
from India, all the Christian Missionaries who were then labouring
there; and for preventing the circulation of the Scriptures in any of
the languages of the East. Nothing could be more probable, therefore,
than that the publication of any accounts of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs labours
among cepcheathen, would draw down upon him the displeasure of the
Indian government. That such, at least, was the persuasion of Mr. C.
is plain enough, for in announcing to a relative, the safe arrival of
his sister in Calcutta, he adds:--

     ‚ÄúI received little of painful intelligence [by her] except
     the news of my letter to Buckworth being published. I trust
     he has not published any more of them. I cannot write to
     him just yet on the subject, lest I should say something
     that might wound his feelings: he has caused me more grief
     than any event of late has caused me.‚Äù

Soon afterwards he more fully expressed his apprehensions in a letter
to Mr. Buckworth himself.

     ‚ÄúI heard some time since by a friend, that ‚Äòa letter from
     one of the Bengal chaplains who came out in 1806,‚Äô had been
     published, and in the then state of the court of India
     Directors towards the evangelization of this country,
     might be of great detriment. Mary afterwards brought me
     word who the offending chaplain is, and who the friend is
     that has published his letters. I confess that for a time
     I felt myself wounded in the house of friendship. In the
     eyes of the world, pride told me that my character would
     suffer; and I still expect to see myself caricatured by
     the Edinburgh Reviewers, or by some such enemies to all
     serious acknowledgment of God. My brother will say, what is
     character &c., to being useful to the cause of the gospel?
     And so say I, if loss of character stand in competition
     with that cause; but really I am sure there must in my
     scrawls, written in the fulness of my heart, be ample
     matter for criticism; and truly the gospel needs not such
     a sorry assistant; especially if the publication should
     operate either to my recal, or to restrictions being laid
     upon mpchere. So well assured am I, however, of the purity
     of my much-loved friend in his motives for thus sending
     me into the world as an author, that I shall love the rod
     even d√©sekmites me by his hand: and he will rejoice that
     I stand ready to glory in the cross of Christ, and count
     myself honoured, if thought worthy to suffer shame for
     His sake. I hope you have not sent any more of my letters
     to the Christian Guardian; and that if you judge any
     description of the people or customs, &c. interesting, you
     will give it as an extract, and without my name and place
     of abode, further than India. I must absolutely forbid
     you to publish what I am doing. Let the great day of the
     Lord make that manifest. I am sure I shall be found an
     unprofitable servant, and ‚Äòthis shall be my only plea, that
     Jesus lived and died for me.‚Äô‚Äù

During the whole of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs stay in Calcutta he took up his
abode with the Rev. David Brown, from whose counsel and directions
he seems to have derived at all times the greatest advantage. To the
relative referred to above, he writes on this occasion;--

     ‚ÄúWe are now under the roof of Mr. Brown. I cannot tell you
     how much we are indebted to this man of God: he has been,
     and is to us younger chaplains, a father in Israel. His
     affection for us exceeds the affection of most fathers for
     their children. His letters convey the instructions of a
     Bishop, with the tenderness of a brother. I trust we feel
     his worth and value it aright.‚Äù

Yet Mr. Corrie‚Äôs anxiety to get back again to his people at Chunar,
did not allow him to remain long in Calcutta. In the letter just now
quoted he observes:--

     ‚ÄúMy few sheep are in the wilderness without a shepherd, and
     some of whom I hoped better things I hear are gone astray:
     these thoughts make every place strange to me except
     Chunar. There is no one thing on earth worth living for,
     but to be employed in our blessed master‚Äôs service, to be
     ministering in obedience to His will to the spiritual and
     temporal good of mankind. When my soul ceases to labour
     after this, life will be no blessing to me. How precious
     the idea th©sekaints are kept by the power of God! This is
     the ground on which I build my hope, of perseverance to
     the end; and I know whom I have believed. He who has given
     me to know the name of Christ, and to trust therein, will
     enable me to draw out all the virtues contained in that
     precious name to support me under temptation, and to enable
     me to holiness of living.‚Äù

Owing, however, to the tedious nature of the passage up the Ganges,
Mr. C. did not reach Chunar till the middle of January 1809. On his
way, he spent a week with Mr. Martyn at Dinapore, and preached there
on Christmas-day 1808. On the following New year‚Äôs day, he placed on
record his recollections of the past year:--

     ‚ÄúChuprah; on the way back from Calcutta to Chunar. Sunday,
     Jan. 1st. 1809. I desire to review this year past, as in
     God‚Äôs presence, and to note down His dealings, as I shall
     give account at t√©kjudgment-seat of Christ.

     ‚ÄúFirst, let me note His mercies _ministerial_, in the
     success of my labours at Chunar; where a society of
     fourteen are united in the ways of God; second, _personal_,
     in the preservation of life, and the vouchsafing of
     excellent health; the bringing my sister, who is now with
     me, and promises to be indeed a helpmeet for me. Third,
     _spiritual_, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit is not withdrawn
     from me; nor has the purpose of living only to God forsaken
     me: I see that nothing is worth living for, but to live
     to God. I determine, the Lord being my helper, to live
     to no other purpose.... I am not so watchful of myself
     as formerly; but I renew my purposes, would do my first
     works, and go on unto perfection. I seem, as far as I know
     myself, kept from the love of wealth; but this is, in some
     degree at least, from lavishness, which hurries me often
     into the other extreme: against this, too, do I resolve;
     and would use this world‚Äôs goods as one that must give an
     account. The work of the Lord among the heathen shall be
     attended to, with fresh vigour. I can say nothing of the
     Hindoostanees at Chunar, nor of the Schools; but I hope to
     do more for them than ever. O Lord, let past mercies be
     remembered, as a constraining motive to future exertion;
     and, whilst I would mourn for my sins and short-coming, O
     keep me in time to come for Christ‚Äôs sake. Amen.‚Äù

Under the date of Chunar, Jan. 24, 1809, he writes,

     ‚ÄúHave been at home ten days, and I trust have not been
     quite forgetful of the goodness of God, in taking me out
     and bringing me back in safety: but I feel and deplore my
     hard heartedness and corruption. On Sunday week resumed
     duty at Secrole, twenty attended. Here, on Sunday last,
     five services have renewed something of my former pain in
     the breast. But, alas! my labours seem all to have been in
     vain. Not one seems to have stood his ground. My heart is
     greatly cast down, and would fain shrink from any further
     trial. Self and worldliness combine to dishearten me from
     the work of the Lord. O Lord, leave me not, but revive thy
     work in me for Jesus‚Äô sake! Amen.‚Äù

In a letter addressed to Mr. Buckworth on the 8th. of Feb; Mr. C.
gives utterance to similar feelings of discomfort:--

     ‚ÄúNotwithstanding the many objects new to you, with which I
     am surrounded, I scarce know what to write to you about: it
     is a time of great spiritual dulness with me; and, owing
     to the indisposition of the native teacher, the great work
     we have chiefly at hearsekeems at a stand. My strength is
     laid out, in the mean time, among the European soldiers;
     and, alas, to little seeming purpose ... I am ready to be
     weary of what appears so hopeless a task as the turning
     of men, so incorrigible, from the error of their ways:
     these workings of my mind are too glaringly impious to
     escape even my half-awakened perception, and the greatest
     of all opposition I find to spring from my desperately
     wicked heart: I trust something of self-abasement, for this
     horribly rebellious spirit, exists at t√©ksame time.

     ‚ÄúYou know all the controversy that has arisen at home
     respecting missions to this country:[47] there is no
     knowing what the end of such opposition to Christ‚Äôs kingdom
     will be. We have been in expectation of a visit from the
     French over land. The late events in Spain may be the means
     of keeping us longer quiet here. The French would perhaps
     have established their system of worship where they could
     have got footing; and any mode of Christianity would have
     been preferable to the idolatry and superstition that
     overwhelms this unhappy land. My principal employment now
     is with a school of Christian native children, five in
     number: some of them read easily the Holy Scriptures in
     Hindoostanee; and a gleam of joy sometimes enlivens my mind
     while hearing them.

     ‚ÄúFeb. 15th. Since writing the above, the old native
     Christian has been enabled to renew his labours; and
     another christian child is come to school. I have had
     one of those sudden attacks you happily know little of
     in England; it has not yet left me; but my times are in
     God‚Äôs hand. I find it is good to be afflicted: my soul
     returns unto her rest; and, I bless God for a desire only
     to know and glorify Him: this I think I can say is all in
     all with me. You will have heard of the Roman-catholic
     mission established in this country. My Catechist is a
     fruit of this mission; and four men and four children in
     my employ besides. They are natives of Bettiah in the
     kingdom of Nepaul, i. e., the old kingdom of Nepaul; for
     now the British posterity of Japheth are dwelling in almost
     every corner of the tents of these sons of Shem; and the
     old limits of most of the states of this country are in
     consequence altered.

     ‚ÄúOne man from the same place passed the whole of your
     summer with me here; and daily read the Scripture with me;
     in which he seems to bukoaught of God. On returning last
     September, he withstood the Missionary (an Italian) to his
     face, respecting the praying to saints, bowing to images
     &c.: he was, in consequence, excommunicated; and, on being
     taken ill soon afterwards was beset by two agents of the
     missionary, who sounded threatenings of hell, &c., in his
     ears; and declared his body should be cast on the dunghill.
     Distressed, it seems he paid a fine to be restored to the
     Church, and soon after died. In his last days, he begged
     some one of his relations to convey his thanks to me,
     and to commend his children to me. The message is come,
     and the unfeigned tears of these few Christians here on
     learning the end of Anselmo, were a striking proof of the
     sympathizing spirit induced by Christianity, compared
     with the hard and unfeeling spirit of the heathen. On the
     map of Hindoostan you see the country of the Seiks; their
     capital is Lahore. The state consists of a number of
     independent chiefs, under a nominal head; many of these
     chiefs have sought our aid against t√©koppression of their
     head; and, as the country they inhabit lies in route of any
     overland invading army, we have sent a force in aid of the
     petitioners. Two of my young friends (very dear to me in
     our common Lord) are with this force. The principal matter
     of interest to us in this expedition is, that t√©se Seiks
     are, as a nation, Deists.[48] Much superstition, indeed, is
     among them; but they are neither Hindoos nor Mussulmans;
     and profess themselves worshippers of one invisible God.
     Such a state of mind seems favourable to a reception of
     Christianity; and, may we not hope our intercourse among
     them may be the means of bringing them acquainted with that
     only name whereby they must b©ksaved? Martyn is going on,
     in company with the converted Arabian,[49] in translating
     the Scriptures into Persian. I have seen the Edinburgh
     Reviewer‚Äôs remarks on the Missionaries[50] and critique
     on their Journals. It is to be regretted, perhaps, that
     in some expressions they are open to ridicule; but it is
     a subject of gratification that in none are they open to
     reproach. These same gentlemen would gnash their teeth
     to find Hindoostan, from near Delhi, yea from the Seiks‚Äô
     country, to Cape Comorin, planted with Christians, who
     daily pray for the coming of Christ‚Äôs kingdom in their
     lands; and who, in their intercourse with those around
     them, recommend the gospel of God our Saviour in a way not
     such as will excite insurrection, but induce veneration
     and ultimately conversion. A preaching life these
     Edinburgh reviewers themselves cannot gainsay; and these
     less enlightened heathen are less disposed than they to
     withstand it. But little visible effect will appear in our
     day; the next generation will find a people ‚Äòprepared for
     the Lord.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúOur dwelling is on the banks of the Ganges. The common
     mode of travelling is by water, in commodious boats,
     dragged, when the wind is adverse, like barges. At t√is
     distance from home, hospitality to strangers seems to me a
     peculiar though painful duty, as it breaks in too much upon
     my leisure. There is no such thing as an inn; and very many
     of the passers-by are young officers, whose situation is,
     in general, far from being comfortable. To these I would
     be especially kind, as being also less noticed by many who
     judge of the attentions due to them by the wealth and rank
     they possess. Those youths who are now here join readily
     in our family worship, and delight me when I hear them
     repeating the Lord‚Äôs prayer after me with seriousness. Dear
     lads, my heart yearns over them, exposed as they are to
     every kind of temptation, without a rudder or a pilot. May
     God take them into His direction!‚Äù

Soon after the date of the foregoing letter, Mr. Corrie was again
suffering from illness. An attack of fever rendered it necessary for
him to place himself under medical care; but throughout the months of
February and March, his disorder seems to have yielded so little to
the remedies applied, that he was almost laid aside from duty. Thus
in his Journal under date of March 19th. he remarks:--

     ‚ÄúMarch 19th (Sunday.) To-day--not in a condition for
     public worship: so there was none in the morning. A
     merchant and others came to breakfast; and I had family
     worship with them. I have been considering my ways, but am,
     alas Iksadly clouded, so that I can remember but little.
     My impatience respecting the backsliding professors has
     appeared, as it is,ksadly inconsistent: I ought to have
     pitied and prayed for them more, and felt less anger. I
     bless God for more composure of mind, and drawing out of
     soul towards God. Iksee, however, I have little of zeal
     for His glory and house. I would have a more single eye in
     this matter. I would desire my own salvation as a means
     of displaying the glory of His grace. I would desire the
     salvation of sinners, that He may be glorified. I would
     engage in proper means for these ends, with a single
     intent that I may bring glory to God, and that God may
     be glorified in me. Let my own personal trials be all
     sanctified to this end! Give grace, O God of grace, to this
     end; and the glory shall redound to Thee, through Jesus
     Christ, the Saviour!‚Äù

And again, a fortnight later, he writes:--

     ‚ÄúEaster eve. To-morrow the Lord‚Äôs Supper is to be
     administered. Alas, my soul, how many sacred opportunities
     of this kind have been little better than profaned. Long
     did I attend the Lord‚Äôs Table in my own self-confident
     spirit, and the same day saw me break the vows Ikhad
     solemnly made. When this self-confidence was in some
     measure discovered, the ordinance became more profitable
     indeed, but the contrary spirit grew upon me; and for
     some time, I fear, the consecrated elements have been too
     little considered. Lord! never let me fancy the means any
     other than the channels of thy grace; but O, enable me to
     discern the Lord‚Äôs body at his Table, and ‚Äòwith meek heart
     and due reverence,‚Äô feed upon Him by faith! My illness, I
     fear, does not leave me; at least, weakness grows upon me.
     I seem anxious to live.... I would live to glorify God,
     too, though he needs not my wretched poor services. I would
     have my will swallowed up in His. O [Lord] grant me grace
     to this end, then come life or death, all will be well.

     ‚ÄúEaster-day morning, 2nd April. Both in public worship,
     and afterwards, I trust the Lord was present to heal us:
     the people were very attentive. I remembered my native
     land, with sweet recollection, the tabernacle of God, and
     the communion of saints. For my companions‚Äô and brethren‚Äôs
     sakes will I seek thy good, O Britain, the Zion of the
     earth! O may these impressions of love and grace remain
     upon my soul! Enough Iksee, even in this day‚Äôs services,
     though unusually joyous, to render precious Him who bears
     the iniquities of his people‚Äôs holy things.‚Äù

In the beginning of the following month, however, a letter to the
Rev. David Brown contains the intelligence that it had pleased God to
recover Mr. Corrie from his illness:--

                                           ‚ÄúChunar, May 11, 1809.

     ‚ÄúI ought to have made known to you before this, the safe
     arrival of the Bibles and New Testaments. We have no troops
     here at present to dispose of them to. The Europeans
     hereabout will take a few to distribute at prime cost. A
     fortnight since beloved Martyn passed this by _dawk_.[51]
     He staid only three days, and you will have heard by this
     time of his safe arrival at Cawnpore on the 29th. ult.
     Sabat has left us this morning. The heat of his temper
     broke out against a washerman who had changed a sheet,
     but there seems no doubt of the grace of God being in
     him. He lived with us since the 7th. At Benares, he had
     intended to pass some days, but about forty persons who
     had formerly known him, came tumultuously to the boat,
     and after much confused dispute, he thought it prudent to
     come on here. We have for some time been engaged about a
     Church at Benares; a subscription of about 3000 Rupees has
     been made, and a spot of ground is fixed on. Iktrust now
     all opposition is silenced, though not entirely done away.
     The hearts of some haters of all good have been brought
     to give money even. One family is highly respectable and
     regular in religious duties. One young officer has become
     a new creature. Of the rest, few alas! seem willing to
     go any further. Martyn wishes for my removal. I did not
     desire it before he came, now I should have no objection to
     it. Less labour than is now put forth on, perhaps in all,
     eighty people, (for the remainder give me no opportunity
     of labouring for them,) would serve for eight hundred,
     and if winning souls be our highest wisdom, the more we
     win, the wiser we shall be accounted. Yet the fear that
     my Benares congregation would be left without a shepherd,
     makes me glad to continue. At Chunar, all seem dead and
     lifeless. Some of the poor women are indeed, growing in
     grace, and that should not be accounted little. One of them
     two days since, on asking her in what way she must attain
     to God‚Äôs presence with peace, replied, ‚ÄòIf I remember the
     name of Jesus Christ: and repenting of my sins, put my
     trust in him, I shall doubtless attain God‚Äôs presence.‚Äô
     Several are equally well informed, and Martyn expressed
     great satisfaction at their attentive repetition of the
     responses, in prayer &c. Sabat holds my poor old man in
     utter disdain for his comparative ignorance. Sabat is
     indeed a very superior man; none of the Moonshees can
     stand before him. He is most amusing with his logic on
     all occasions. Some of the gay friends of a pious young
     officer, asked him if it were not written in Scripture,
     that men shall become bears? He, in the simplicity of his
     heart, asked Martyn and myself at Dinapore, before Sabat,
     if there were such a passage of Scripture? Sabat replied,
     ‚ÄòO if there is such an expression in the word of God, it
     must be true; and we will prove it by logic.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúI think I expressed a wish for the tables you mentioned,
     of Arabic &c. with a copy of the Persian of Matthew when
     ready. Mr. Myers[52] would send them and they would be
     highly useful. I am happy to say the complaint I was ill
     of has quite left me, and I trust it is good for me that
     I was in trouble. It is good in any way to have the heart
     separated from this ensnaring world; to be led to have all
     its fresh springs in God. Would it were more thus with me!
     I groan being burdened with an earthly, sensual, devilish
     nature. I wish I could hear oftener of you and your‚Äôs. I am
     in hopes those communications that respect our project may
     pass through my hands to Martyn; it would cause only one
     day‚Äôs delay. The subject of the conversion of the natives
     is much more discussed among us. I know two converts to the
     subject from reading Buchanan‚Äôs Memoir which I lent them.

     ‚ÄúMy Christian School goes on well.

     ‚ÄúBeside the Christian children, I have six Christian men,
     and some families.‚Äù

The anniversary of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs ordination is thus noticed by him:--

     ‚ÄúSaturday, June 10th. This day in 1802, I was ordained a
     Deacon at Buckden, and on the 12th of June 1804, a Priest,
     at the same place. To-morrow may suit my purposed season of
     examination; and I pray God to enable me to this needful
     work. First, to look over my present spiritual state.
     Secondly, To examine my views in the ministry. Thirdly, To
     pray for my Native School. O Lord! vouchsafe a spirit of
     grace and supplication for Christ‚Äôs sake!

     ‚ÄúSunday, June 11th. Have been considering my ways; and
     respecting my personal experience, it is but too apparent
     that I have for some time laboured under a spiritual
     decay. The commencement of it seems to have been soon
     after this time last year, when my spirit began to faint
     in outward duties; and I hurried away from them to
     Calcutta. The Lord does not leave me; and I trust will
     not leave me; yet, O my soul, fear being given up to work
     iniquity. Much reserve, I am aware, in my outward conduct
     is worn off: respecting this, I would hope the needless
     scrupulosity I indulged is going; yet connected with my
     private experience, I would be jealous over myself with
     a godly jealousy. Frivolousness and levity in tongue and
     action, I would watch against. Lord, instruct me, and teach
     me in thy way! In the ministry, I have failed greatly in
     respect of searching out the lost sheep of Christ‚Äôs flock;
     nor have I a proper sense of the hurt and hinderance
     arising from this negligence. Lord, grant me a due sense
     of the Saviour‚Äôs dying love, and of the soul‚Äôs worth! I
     think I do attempt the edification of those who come in my
     way; and have less fear of shame and reproach for Christ
     than once I had. I find a growing facility in speaking
     Hindoostanee; and I trust of late more earnest intention
     of seeking opportunities of propagating the Gospel. My
     views in coming to India I would hope are not altered; to
     live and die here; and to spend my strength and substance
     in this land is, I think, my purpose. The little children
     are becoming very interesting to me. O, that they may
     become partakers of the grace of God in truth! My native
     servants I would try to make wise unto salvation, and often
     am earnestly engaged in instructing them. Lord, grant
     me sincerity and simplicity in dealing with these; and
     enable me to repent of my sins, to ‚Äòdo my first works;‚Äô
     and ‚Äòleaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, go
     on unto perfection.‚Äô I feel how entirely it is Thy work
     to accomplish this in me, then grant me thy Holy Spirit
     graciously for Christ‚Äôs sake. Amen!‚Äù

With what sincerity of spirit, this recital of his inward resolves
and feelings was penned, may be gathered from the renewed activity
with which Mr. Corrie‚Äôs restored health was devoted to the employment
of every means within his reach, that was calculated to extend the
knowledge of Christ. To Mr. Brown he writes early in June 1809:--

     ‚ÄúI have at length begun the Arabic and Hebrew; and with the
     help of the Arabic, Hebrew and Hindoostanee, hope to get a
     correct Hindoostanee version of the Psalms for the black
     flock. The 51st Psalm they are learning by heart.‚Äù

Similar notices of his application to the study of the Oriental
languages occur, also, in Mr. Corrie‚Äôs letters, about this time,
to Mr. Martyn. Yet the external circumstances with which himself
and fellow-labourers in the work of the Lord, were all this while
conversant, were far from encouraging. In the letter to Mr. Brown
quoted above, Mr. Corrie complained:--

     ‚ÄúMy harp has long been ‚Äòhung upon the willows.‚Äô Every thing
     around us bears the image of spiritual death. What little
     profession there was among us, has issued in nothing that
     appears decisive.‚Äù

And a few weeks later, after recording in his journal that he ‚Äúhad
often experienced the Divine Presence and grace,‚Äù whilst lecturing in
public ‚Äúon the Epistle to the Galatians,‚Äù Mr. C. adds:--

     ‚ÄúI am, nevertheless, cast down greatly with the little
     appearance of good working among us: the soldiers seem
     hardened to all addresses I make: the old native Christian
     has not been lively of late. When not living near to God,
     I seem afraid of the doctrine of grace, as it is called;
     when my soul is deeply affected with divine truth, I can
     trust God with the consequences of His own declarations.‚Äù

Whilst having thus to lament the spiritual apathy around him, Mr.
Corrie did not on that account slacken his exertions toward hastening
on the day, when ‚Äúthe stream of Ganges shall roll through tracts
adorned with Christian churches, and the holy hymn be heard beneath
the shade of the tamarind.‚Äù Accordingly he writes to the Rev. Charles
Simeon:--

                                                   ‚ÄúAug. 2, 1809.

     ‚ÄúA door of usefulness has been opened ‚Äòamong those of mine
     own nation‚Äô at Benares, where I have been enabled to attend
     every third Sunday, and now materials are collecting to
     build a place of worship with, by subscription. Some of the
     principal people there oppose the measure by their private
     influence, though they have given money for the work.
     The report of the death of one of the chaplains above,
     renders me anxious, lest I should be removed before this
     scheme is accomplished; but I know the accomplishment of
     it rests not with me. I now confine my public engagements
     to the mornings, except one service in Hindoostanee on
     Sunday evenings. I have mentioned a native Christian who
     reads and expounds the lessons on these occasions, so
     that my labour is but small when he is present. Just now,
     he is at Benares, with a view, if possible, to establish
     Christian worship among a number of Portuguese and native
     Christians, who reside in various capacities there. He
     goes from house to house among them, but has hitherto had
     little success. Only three attend worship. I may remind
     you, [that] he conducts public worship according to our
     Church form, translated. The Gospels we have, and I have
     translated the principal particulars of the Old Testament
     history. I may mention that the wisdom of God is manifest
     here, in recording the faults of the Old Testament saints.
     A maxim among all classes of Natives, seems to be, that
     every person, by obeying his own religious guide, will
     attain eternal blessedness, and several of the Mahomedans
     have been offended, at my asserting that Moses, Abraham,
     David &c., were sinners: the proving these saints to have
     been sinners by nature, as ourselves, overturns this
     conceit and makes them to seek out a Saviour, who is
     himself in no need of salvation. To this point, when I have
     opportunity, I always bring a Mahomedan, carefully avoiding
     disrespectful mention of his Prophet. The Hindoostanee
     women attend, though not in such numbers as at first, yet
     regularly, and I have no doubt some of these most despised
     of the human race, will be found at the right hand of the
     Judge, in the great day. A few evenings since, a poor
     blind creature caused my heart to joy exceedingly, by her
     artless commendation of the Redeemer; any praise of myself
     might have arisen from servility, but, the epithets she
     applied to our Lord, could have been learned only from the
     Scriptures. For some time much of my attention has been
     directed to the education of some native christian boys.
     Watts‚Äô first Catechism they can repeat, and a prayer for
     morning and evening in private; two of them have begun
     Persian and make quick progress: there are in all five,
     from seven to twelve years old, and some younger children
     will soon be admitted. I am attempting to introduce
     our own mode of teaching, and when at home, hear them
     twice a day.... No pains have been spared by the Italian
     Missionaries, at Bettiah to frighten, or allure my old
     teacher from me, and one man, who had learned the way of
     God more perfectly here, and on going back refused to
     pray to saints, &c., was excommunicated and grievously
     persecuted until his death, which took place soon after.
     The uproar about Missions has been heard of here, but
     no one feels any of the alarm expressed at home. I hear
     occasionally, from some friends at Malda, of Mr. M. who
     has very poor health; some poor helpless creatures have
     lately received baptism there. You will not suspect me of
     depreciating his labours, by this expression; those among
     whom I myself minister, are as despicable as human beings
     can well be. Their influence on the general cause can be
     none, their individual souls are precious.‚Äù

Mr. Corrie had now been three years in India, and it will have
been seen that those years had not been spent in self-indulgent
inactivity, or had been unfruitful in great moral results. Yet he
writes:--

     ‚ÄúSept. 20th. 1809. This day completes my third year in
     India; and though I could write a journal of events that
     would set me off in the eyes of men, I know myself to be
     an unprofitable servant. I have reason to cry, ‚ÄòDeliver me
     from blood-guiltiness, O God;‚Äô from the blood of souls! The
     perverseness of the natives draws out my perverse temper. I
     perceive my mind of late too much taken up with the dignity
     religion inspires the mind with, raising it above the petty
     cares and mean jealousies of an earthly mind: yet, O let
     me never be high-minded but fear. I desire to renew my
     dedication of myself, my all to God; to purpose greater
     exertion and more labours among whites and blacks. Lord, I
     pray thee, grant an increase of spiritual influence, that
     I may go on from grace to grace! O, let me not faint nor
     tire, for Jesus‚Äô sake, Amen!‚Äù

The following letters to his Christian friends, bear witness that Mr.
Corrie was enabled, in some measure, to carry out the desires and
purposes which his Journal records.


                            REV. D. BROWN.

                                          ‚ÄúChunar, Oct. 12. 1809.

     ‚ÄúI have had our meeting service this morning. Cold myself
     and lifeless and stupid. I wonder the people attend at all,
     they are so little excited to run the Christian race.

     ‚ÄúThe Christian Native School goes on as well as it can.
     The children, sometimes nine in number, are reading
     the Scriptures in Hindoostanee. I have nearly finished
     a corrected edition (about the 4th) of the history of
     creation, Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Joseph, Moses,
     the children of Israel, Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon,
     the division of the Tribes, Elijah, Elisha, the Acts of
     the Apostles, the first Epistle of John. Four of the
     children have Watts‚Äô first Catechism perfect, with prayers
     for morning and evening. Two of these have begun Persian
     Grammar, on a new plan of my own, after the English mode
     of question and answer. We have ten Christians about us
     with whom I read and pray, most mornings, in Hindoostanee.
     One youth appears truly pious and reads and explains the
     Scriptures, admirably to others, most evenings after dark.
     A few of the Hindoostanee Women appeared [to be] guided by
     the fear of God,--perhaps four or six. The others complain
     of hearing nothing but severe language, and told the Native
     teacher lately [that] ‚Äòas he was paid for instructing them,
     he ought not to deal so severely with them! He told them,
     he was not paid to flatter them.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúI have lately been looking into the Arabic and Hebrew, but
     I entirely despair of making any proficiency in them. The
     Hebrew I shall go on with. Even by the help of the Lexicon,
     I gain great pleasure in observing the roots and their
     connection with the languages around us. If ever you pray
     for me particularly, pray that I may _endure_ to the _end_:
     that _patience_ may _hold out_: that I may be faithful
     _unto death_. May richest grace be multiplied to you and
     your‚Äôs.‚Äù


                      TO THE REV. J. BUCKWORTH.

                                                   ‚ÄúNov, 1. 1809.

     ‚ÄúI often turn a look of regard towards highly favoured
     Britain, and a tear starts whilst I bid it a long adieu;
     but to a weary pilgrim any lodging is welcome, any place
     of abode agreeable; so in Hindoostan, my weary head shall
     rest, and my longing soul mount up from hence to meet her
     redeeming God. There, my brother, we shall meet; till
     then, let our willing feet, our heads, and our tongues be
     employed in spreading the Saviour‚Äôs glorious name.

                The Saviour! O what endless charms
                Dwell in the blissful sound!

     Your sermon referred to would have suited my people here.
     In much weakness and fear, indeed, I have been among them.
     The Evening Lectures I told you of exhausted me entirely;
     and conspired with other circumstances to bring on a liver
     complaint, from which, I sometimes think, I am not quite
     free: but I am able to endure my labour.

     ‚ÄúYou expect to hear of my black flock. My native teacher
     is, at this time, laid up with Asthma: his notions
     of divine truth grow more clear daily. Some of the
     Hindoostanee wives of the soldiers have, also gained good
     information on christian subjects; and from forty to sixty
     regularly attend public worship on Sundays, and once in the
     week. I have nine Christian men and women, and six children
     about me; with these I read and pray in Hindoostanee every
     morning I am at home. One lad of them appears truly pious;
     he has been with me most of the time I have been here; he
     reads and prays in the evenings with the others generally.

     ‚ÄúOne night lately I heard him expounding part of the
     sixteenth chapter of St. John with much feeling and
     propriety. I have the charge of him entirely; I begin
     to love him, and think his disposition gentle and
     well-inclined: he always attends at meals for his portion.
     The other servants, at times, I hear tell him he is become
     an Englishman; and seem to envy him not a little.... I
     could fill sheets with the conversations I frequently
     have with the natives. Several promising appearances in
     individuals, have come to nothing. I am, therefore, glad
     that I have not written any thing about them.

     ‚ÄúThere has been a serious disturbance here (and it is not
     now quite over) between the Mahomedans and Hindoos. The
     former destroyed a pillar, long an object of superstition
     amongst the Hindoos: on which account the latter carried
     swine and slaughtered them in the Mosques. One hundred and
     forty have lost their lives; but not all from religious
     difference, many taking occasion of the affray to gratify
     private revenge.[53]

     ‚ÄúI can say nothing of my prospects: all you can picture of
     the difficulties attending this work is far short of the
     reality. I can only say, to live and die in this work, or
     to labour until I can do no more, is my not hasty purpose,
     formed, I trust, on no self-sufficient grounds, but on the
     grace, mercy, and comfort of an unchanging God and Saviour.

     ‚ÄúI am writing a little daily in Hindoostanee, Persian,
     Arabic, or Hebrew. My school employs me two portions of
     the day. I am cheered sometimes with the hope, that I am
     educating Missionaries; but it seems hardly possible they
     should escape the pollutions around them.‚Äù

     REMOVES FROM CHUNAR--ARRIVES AT CAWNPORE--ILLNESS OF MR. MARTYN.


At the end of the year 1809, Mr. Corrie having been directed to
remove from Chunar to Agra, made preparations for proceeding to the
latter station. In the meantime, however, he suffered so much from
the illness mentioned in the preceding letter to Mr. Buckworth, that
for three months he omitted to keep any record of his proceedings. On
the 3rd of Feb. 1810, he observes:--

     ‚ÄúFebruary 3rd. 1810. I have had much searching of heart in
     review of my purposes and projects at different seasons of
     my life, often purposing diligence in acquiring languages;
     at other times my chief desire and labour being wholly in
     the immediate duties of the ministry; and, to be altogether
     separated from mere visiting society. I perceive myself
     to have succeeded in no one scheme; and am to this day
     unprofitable and without ability to any good. Long, long
     have I known this in theory, but evidently did not think
     it of myself. May this sad experience lead me to true
     humility and deep contrition; may it lead me to prayer,
     and to diligence in the means of grace! The sickness upon
     me is more violent than last year, but seems yielding to
     medicine; for which I would bless the Lord, and devote
     myself to His cause. These two Sabbaths I have been laid
     aside from public work, and fear I am not sufficiently
     humbled. O, how I ought to thirst after the courts of the
     Lord! I think I should greatly regret being kept from the
     ministry another Sabbath, but am ready to give up all hopede by of success from my own labours. I know this is from a
     forgetfulness of the Scripture, and of the power of God.
     Lord, awaken a spirit of faith and prayer! The old man goesde by on instructing the native women, successfully, in a few
     cases, I hope.

     ‚ÄúThe Roman Catholic padre, with a fair carriage towards me
     tries all he can in private to counteract this old man. O,
     that I were as in days and months past: and, O, that the
     Lord would make His word to prosper among us: and, O, that
     He may direct and prosper my way to Agra, and make me there
     a blessing for Jesus‚Äô sake!‚Äù

The chief circuman dces of interest connected with the remaining
portion of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs residence at Chunar, are related in the
following extracts from his letters and Journal. As, however, in
those extracts there occur some allusions to an Institution, which
about this time sprung up in India, a few words of information will
not be out of place.

The patronage which the Marquis Wellesley (then Earl of Mornington)
extended to a plan for translating the Scriptures into the languages
of the East, had excited the hope that our rule in India would become
the means of imparting the knowledge of the true God to millions of
our fellow men: but the retirement of that large-minded Nobleman
from the government of India, was followed by that determined
opposition to the diffusion of the gospel among the natives of
Hindoostan, of which so many traces have already appeared in the
pages of this Memoir. The consequence was, that notwithsn dding
all attempts of Dr. Buchanan, Mr. Brown and others, to procure
translations and copies of the Scriptures; and though aided in
their efforts by grants of money from the Bible Society in England,
yet there was a famine of the word of God even among the native
Christians of India. This dearth of Bibles seems to have pressed
more especially upon the Christians of Tanjore, so that in a sermon
preached in Calcutta, on New-year‚Äôs day 1810, Mr. Brown was induced
to make an appeal on their behalf. The result was that a liberal
subscription, headed by General Hewitt, the commander-in-chief,
was raised for the purpose of forwarding the distribution of the
Tamul Scriptures in Tanjore. Encouraged by the success which
attended this effort to procure a larger circulation of the Word
of God, Mr. Brown and his friend proceeded to originate measures
of larger enterprise. They established a _Bibliotheca Biblica_, an
institution which consisted of a ‚ÄúTranslation library‚Äù and a ‚ÄúBible
repository.‚Äù The ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù was intended to contain the Scriptures
in the original languages, Lexicons, Grammars, works on Biblical
criticism, and generally, all such books as were likely to be useful
to translators. The ‚ÄúBible repository‚Äù was designed to contain Bibles
and Testaments in all languages, European as well as Asiatic, to be
disposed of at moderate prices.[54] It will be seen that with ‚Äúthis
judicious and efficient instrument‚Äù for good, Mr. Corrie readily
united himself.


                      TO THE REV. J. BUCKWORTH.

                                                 ‚ÄúMarch 12, 1810.

     ‚ÄúI cannot recollect how long it is since I was favoured
     with a letter from you: so many are the accidents to which
  by our letters are exposed between Britain and India, that I
     attribute the little intercourse we have had to some of
     these; and, therefore, add one more to the many letters I
     have sent you; and trust to hear of you when opportunity
     serves. Sometimes my mind has been deeply affected with
     the idea of growing old without a friend, or solace of
     declining years. Gray has well described the feelings of
     Nature in the lines:

            ‚ÄòOn some fond breast the parting soul reliesde by         Some pious drops the closing eye requires.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúIt is the privilege of faith, indeed, to raise the soul
     above creature dependencies; and, I bless God that, in
 e bygeneral, I am enabled to say ‚Äònone of these things move
     me.‚Äô Still, I cling, with the fondest recollection, to the
     hours I have spent with you, and the adv dces in knowledge,
     and I would hope in grace, my soul made in your society;
     nor can I endure the thought of our intercourse being at an
     end.

     ‚ÄúIn this strange land, God has also supplied several
     whose letters and occasional visits are a source of great
     comfort and encouragement to me. I believe the number
  by of true Christians is increasing among us, and as these
     abound ‚Äòthe desert will blossom as the rose;‚Äô and thisde by wilderness shall be glad for them. The only principal
     cause of concern is the small adv dces that are making
     towards the ev dgelization of the Hindoos and Mahomedans.
     If you cast your eye over the map, you will perceive the
     distance between the different abodes of the Europeans;
     and then, suppose even at those stations something may be
     doing toward this work, how is the intervening space to be
     supplied?...

     ‚ÄúI am recovered from another attack of the liver,
     much severer than last year‚Äôs, and which prevented me
     from public duty for three Sabbaths: I reckon these
     interruptions as the choicest blessings. The vain mind
     is tempted, in full health, to lay up for many years;
     but these warnings strongly impress the exhortation,
     ‚Äòwhatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúMy European flock, as to numbers, has been at a sn dd
  by of late: some of them, however, are now g userunto some
     stature in Christ; and are a source of great refreshment at
     times....

     ‚ÄúThe old native Christian has improved of late, and some
     of the native Christian flock give good evidence of a true
     conversion. At times, whilst ministering among these, my
     heart overflows with delight; and the simplicity with which
  by they express themselves is very striking. I only wish the
     number of them was greater: for, alas! who, in comparison
 e byhath yet ‚Äòbelieved our report?‚Äô

     ‚ÄúI am removed from this station to Agra, once the imperial
     city, where are the most splendid remains of fallen
 e bygreatness in Hindoostan. One of my dear young friends,
     whom I heard of yesterday, says, ‚ÄòYou are the first who
     has been commissioned to preach in that Nineveh repentance
     and remission of sins. I see a peculiar honour conferred
     upon you by this appointment. May God prosper you!‚Äô My
     soul responds, Amen! The Lord grant my entering in among
     them, may be ‚Äònot in word only, but in power, and in the
     Holy Ghost, and in much assurance.‚Äô Hitherto I have been
     prevented from proceeding, but trust shortly to go on my
     way, by the will of God, rejoicing. One comfort attending
     the journey is, that it will take me by the abode of
     dearest Martyn; and with him I shall make some stay.

     ‚ÄúWe regret deeply that no more chaplains, who would lend a
     helping hand, are coming over to assist us. In three years,
     I have been preparing myself, I would hope, for greater
     exertions, by learning languages, &c.; and have done some
     little here towards founding a Christian church; but now,
     alas! the work, to human appearance, will be at a sn dd. My
     old deacon wishes to go with me though, and I shall take
     him; though at first it seemed better to leave him with
     these ‚Äòfew sheep in the wilderness:‚Äô but those of them who
     are most serious have husbands somewhat like-minded, and,
     therefore, are less likely to suffer wrong; and the old man
     will be very useful in a new place. Most of the Christian
     men go with me, in one capacity or another; though they
     are a heavy expense to me. Where we are going, I purpose
     to colonize them, if God in his providence shall supply
  by opportunities. Oh! were you but here to talk over these
     subjects with me! You cannot well have a due idea of thisde by country, nor of our proceedings,runless you were to be with
  by us; but I must restrain my feelings,rand rather give you
     some information that will amuse you.

     ‚ÄúTwo days since, a Brahmin in authority here, and with whom
     I have had many disputes, took away a copy of the gospels,
     after I had read to him some particulars of the death of
     Christ, which impressed him greatly at the time. My removal
     has made him very anxious; and sometime ago, when I wasde by first ordered away, he came, and after many expressions of
     concern said, ‚ÄòSir, I have a great favour to beg before
     you leave this place; pray cause to be written for me
     your account of the first beginning of things,rwith the
 e bygenealogies of the first ages. Before you came, I never
     heard these subjects spoken of, and when you are gone, no
     one will take the trouble to unfold us any hidden thing.‚Äô
     He has now the beginning of Genesis, and the four Gospels.
     Affairs on the continent have taken a most disastrous
     turn[55] to our apprehension; but ‚Äòthe Lord reigneth;‚Äô add
  by one thing we cannot but rejoice in, _the fall of the man of
     sin_.‚Äù


                        TO THE REV. D. BROWN.

                                                 ‚ÄúMarch 15, 1810.

     ‚ÄúI yesterday sent off by _banghy_[56] De Coetlegon‚Äôs
     Sermons, and some chapters of Genesis in Persian,
     translated by my Moonshee from my Hindoostanee
     translations. It is on this account I sent the Sermons,
     as the Moonshee would give me no peace until you should
     have a specimen of his performance, and give your opinion
 e bywhether or no it will be of any use to go on in this
     way. The occasion of doing thus much arose from some
     Mahomedans about the court at Mirzapore desiring from me
     some account of the books of Moses. Mr. Ricketts, the
  by judge, was passing this, and some people in his train.
     They called upon me and immediately expressed a wish to
     see some of the translations they had heard I employed
     myself about. I produced the epitome done by Gladwin, it
     seems,rat the request of Mr. Clarke. This they read for an
     hour at least, and on going away begged a copy. Afterwards
     the Molwhee told the moonshee that the Koran gives a more
     particular account of things than our books. To this the
     moonshee answered, that what he had seen was a very concise
     abridgment, but if he were to see the original he wouldde by forget the Koran. This brought on a violent dispute. To
     make good his assertion, the translation you have a copy
     of was made, and the remainder of the epitome added. Onede by chapter was first sent to Martyn, who approved of it,
     and now you must also see it. Our Cutwal[57] here is a
     Hindoo, and has often, with heat, contended with me about
     the comparative authenticity of our books; but on the
     prospect of my leaving seems softened, and has of his own
     accord begged a copy of the beginning of Genesis and of
     the Gospel; which he has got. He often contends eagerly
  by with the Mahommedans, and puts them to silence by the
 e byarguments he has learnt; and on the riots at Benares a
     great concourse of Mahomedans came to him and my moonshee.
     One night they continued to dispute until midnight, not
     respecting Hindooism and Mahomedanism, but entirely
     respecting the Mahomedan and Christian writings. I hope I
     amygetting better, but not so speedily as last year. Myde by flock is already as without a shepherd. I have not been
     among them for a month. A few came to the house on Sunday
     evening, but the exertion on the occasion, though little
     more than family worship, has thrown me back.‚Äù


                                                  ‚ÄúApril 3, 1810.

     ‚ÄúYour last letter found me very unwell, so much so, that
     greatly as I wished, I could not engage in answering it. I
     have no fear of being forgotten by you, yet these tokens of
     your regard are indeed very acceptable. It seems a weakness
     in my nature that makes me cling to creatures as I do; and
     the same weakness is the source of what you are so kind asde by to call by a softer name.

     ‚ÄúIt would be a cause of deep regret to me to be excludedde by from your ‚ÄòTranslation library;‚Äô you will really oblige
     me by inserting my name among the subscribers, and I will
     make an effort to set all straight with you and all the
     world. After deducting the amount of the house here, which
     I have sold and am to be paid for in August, I do not owe
     above 3000 rupees: yet I do owe all I am, and all I ever
     shall have in my power, to such purposes as you propose. I
     will endeavour first to be just, and then I will glory in
 e bydevoting my all to the propagation of the gospel in India.
     The doctors say there is no occasion for my going down the
  by country, but I shall be guided much by Mr. Robinson.[58]
     He is near at hand; yet come I shall not without some
     alteration for the worse. I have now very little pain, but
     amyweak and incapable of application. I should rejoice more
     in visiting Aldeen than Cawnpore even, for the children are
     all very dear to me, and their playfulness delights me. I
     hear Martyn has received the packet from you, and has heardde by from Mr. Simeon that Cambridge university voted Buchanan,
     a D.D. degree.[59] I hear general M. wishes to reside at
     Ghazeepore with the 67th. The poor old man has thrown
     obstacles in the way of our church till the materials
 e byare likely to be lost, but the congregation increases in
     proportion to the general‚Äôs opposition. W. has often 30 at
     Divine Service, and usually about 20. They sing hymns, and
 e byare generally a very interesting people; though but a few,
     as usual, give evidence of any change.‚Äù


                                         ‚ÄúChunar, April 28, 1810.

     ‚ÄúYour papers have reached me in safety;--viz. 1st. a
     report for 1809. 2nd., the Agra books and papers. 3rd.,
     the Bibliotheca Biblica &c. The ‚ÄòTranslation library‚Äô must
     prove highly useful. I have some of the books you have
     mentioned--A Golius, Dictionarium Arabicum, Schultens,
     Life of Saladin, Stillingfleet‚Äôs Origines Sacr√¶, Wells‚Äôs
     Geography, and others, which shall be sent down, if
     you please; except Golius, which is to be delivered tode by Martyn‚Äôs care on my arrival at Cawnpore. But the ‚ÄòBible
     repository‚Äô delights me. This is beyond all your other
     highly meritorious labours, for the benefit of the present
     generation. I shall send it round here, if I have time,
     but I have only eight days more here, and on my arrival
     at Agra will make it public. On receipt of the Report, I
     sent it to some acquaintance here. One sent it to a rich
     Native[60] in the city, who reads English; he has returnedde by it with a _Hoondee_[61] for 100 rupees, and an addressde by to the Bible Society. I shall, D. V. send it off to the
 e bySecretary in due form on Monday, and he may send it for
     publication; it appears to me an event that would interest
     at home, but you will judge when you see the whole. It
     has delighted me highly. I have been this week at Benaresde by taking leave. E. is not yet arrived. The old gentleman
     there is most gracious always to myself, but is a raging
     bear behind my back against all our measures. It has calledde by forth all my little energy to make the poor stand I have
     against his influence. The Church has been delayed under
     various pretexts twelve months, but the materials were
  by collected. I made those efforts since March, and at length
     got permission to begin last week. Robinson undertook the
     superintendence as a last resource--and his offer wasde by accepted. The gentleman, however, attacked him when the
     work was begun, and called me by name, Augustus Brooke, and
 e bythe Salmons, fanatics, &c. I fear this will make E. less
     forward than he might otherwise have been, but I have left
     a few Bibles and Testaments at Wheatley‚Äôs for sale: most
 e byare already supplied. Though I have not sold one Bible,de by Robinson is anxious to get the Church ready by the time you
 e byarrive. You can find a congregation. Several families and
 e bysome individuals spoke out on my coming away, the fulness
     of a gracious heart. I often think of an expression in a
     prayer of old Carey‚Äôs, in the pagoda, ‚Äòthat in the evening
     of your residence in India you might see the light of truth
     shine abroad.‚Äô Your‚Äôs and his prayer are, I trust, heard.
     There will be a change in European India, yea there is a
  by change; infidelsyare beginning to hide their faces, and
     the youngyare growing up at the different stations, with
     a reverence for the ways of God. I perceive the married
     especially most easily prevailed with. Yesterday, on an
     occasion of extraordinary awakening, I, after two or
     three visits, administered the Lord‚Äôs Supper to a young
     Captain and his wife, and the wife of another officer. The
 e bylatter had called her husband from a party, and entreatedde by him to join our worship; he could scarce refuse. She
 e byappears serving God with all her mind, though not with
     all understanding: I have just been sending her a book.
     It pleases God to continue me still in much weakness, and
 e byno little fear as to my long continuance among you. If I
     desire any thing in life but to speak and act and write
     for Him, I pray He may graciously disappoint me and hidede by from me the evil that would follow; but if He has given me
     a desire to glorify Him, I trust He will spare me a little
     that I may shew forth His praise!‚Äù

It may not be uninteresting to mention, that the letter which Mr.
Corrie states to have been written by a Hindoo to the committee of
the Bible Society, is printed at length in Mr. Owen‚Äôs History of that
Society, (vol. 2. pp. 36-38.) In transmitting the letter, Mr. C.
observed:--

     ‚ÄúThis native has acquired a considerable fortune, in
 e bysome employment under our govern æ , in which it wasde by necessary for him to read and write in English. On being
     pressed by arguments urged for the supreme importance of
     Christianity, he excused himself by saying, ‚ÄòHe thoughtde by if it were so, the British govern æ  would have made the
     Christian religion known to their subjects in this land.‚Äô
     This objection he urged in a variety of ways, and here the
     discussion ended. On receiving the report for 1809, in
 e byanswer to this, he sent an address to the Bible Society,
     written by himself, and now in my possession, requesting
     that it might be corrected; which was done, retaining his
     own expressions as much as possible.‚Äù

de by  e by  e by  e by   e by  e by  e by  e by   ‚ÄúMay 7th. 1810.
de by ‚ÄúThis morning we left Chunar, and are now on our way to
     Cawnpore. I have recovered greatly of late, but now my
     sister is fallen unwell, and thus we are kept dependa ,
 e byand trust we find it best to be so. On Saturday morning,de by Mr. E. arrived, but did not let me know. I however heard
     about mid-day, and straightway sent an invitation to our
     h‰Ωe. In the evening he came, and next morning Mrs. E.
     and the infant; and we have left them this morning in our
     former habitation. I preached a farewell sermon yesterday
     morning, from Romans x. 1., first: pointing out the meaning
     of salvation as including deliverance from danger:--the
     danger arising from sin, the necessity of salvation from
     sin if we would avoid its consequences, as well as to
     make us meet for the inheritance &c. and second: Why I
     wished them to be saved, viz., from the consideration of
 e bythe misery of Hell, the joys of Heaven and the pleasures
     of religion here. There was great attention. I said a
     good deal too, in the conclusion, on the strain of my
     preaching among them,--that I was aware many did not like
 e byit,--but pointed out the necessity of delivering my own
 e bysoul, as well as my desire not so much for their favour
     and approbation, considered in itself, but as connected
     with salvation. Here I intended æ successor should hear
     something of my opinion of our works. In the evening,
     my little flock were full of expressions of kindness,
 e byand I think it was a season that will be remembered. The
 e byHindoostanees came in a body, and made loud expressions
     of regret at my departure, many of them weeping aloud. In
     the evening too I baptized three Caffres, the serva s
     of a gentleman, and who had for some time been underde by instruction. Many were prese , and we begun the service by
     singing some verses from _Veni Creator_. Two of them gave
     pertinent answers to some questions on Christianity; and
 e byon their repeating the creed in Hindoostanee most prese 
     were melted to tears. Mr. G. has, it seems, professed to
     the General that he will never go to Benares, unless he is
     ordered, and the general has declared he will never order
     him. The Church however is going on under Mr. Robinson,
 e byand much interest is excited about it. The military have
     desired him to make the building a handsome one, and they
     will add to the subscription. Thus in spite of Satan and
     those he leads captive, the work of the Lord prospers and
 e bywill prosper. I have had packets of letters on leaving, and
 e byam astonished at the kind acceptance my little more than
     abstaining from evil has met with. It seems to be a wonderde by among them, that I performed my official duty when called
     upon; and especially that I should express my readiness
     to serve them. Dear Mr. R. is greatly excited of late
     towards the best things; his heart has been deeply touched
     by the death of his youngest sister, and he is tenderly
     alive to the blessedness of those who die in the Lord.
     This is a happy event just now, when some of the society
 e bythere, (especially one Captain) seem seri‰Ωly seeking to
     secure the better part. They know his Father‚Äôs character,
 e byand the adva ages he has enjoyed; and also they have
     seen him more retired and more attentive to his duty than
     most; and they seem now to look to him for information.
     We know however, how slow of growth the heavenly pla 
 e byis, from the untowardness of the soil it falls into; we
 e byknow how many blights and thorns it is exposed to: though
     some good appears, we still are not content, but, filled
     with hopes and fears, we watch for the event. I told you
     I had sent the plan of the library to Major Wilford.
     He had not understood me, so I intend writing again. I
     enclose his note with the papers, it will give you a morede by correct idea of his mind towards this work than I can. I
     fear E. will not take any trouble to make known the Bible
     Society proceedings. I send a copy of the advertiseme 
     to Wheatley‚Äôs shop, where it will be seen by many; and
 e byhave left one dozen Bibles, and two dozen New Testame s,
     with Mr. E. at Chunar. Dr. W. I find, does our cause good
     against his will, by his incivility and grasping after
     fees. Do you indeed come up the country? Martyn talks
     of my remaining a month at Cawnpore: at any rate I hope
     to leaveythere to conduct you to the imperial city. It
     perhaps would be of importance to get Martyn to resign the
     service, and give himself to the translating and printing
 e bythe scriptures. He will not eat the bread of idleness, and
 e byit is clear his prese  labours will bring an early peri‰d
     to his life. I scarce know how to writeyit, but so it is. I
     will give you a faithful account from Cawnpore.‚Äù

The following letter, addressed to the Rev. Mr. Simeon of Cambridge,
contains a kind of retrospect of Mr. C‚Äôs labours at Chunar, and is on
that account given at length, at the risk of the repetition of a few
circumstances which have been already mentioned.

                                                  ‚ÄúMay 9th. 1810.

     ‚ÄúI know it will be agreeable to you to hear of the
     progress I am making, if it may be called progress, in the
 e byappointme  I hold. Three years last February, I arrived at
 e byChunar, with very imperfect views of the nature of the work
     I had engaged in; the habits and character of Europeans
     undergo an almost entire change, after a few years
     residence here, so that our work among the Europeans takes
 e bya different turn from the work of the ministry in Englad.
     We haveyto argue for the sanctity of the sabbath, the
     extensive import of the seventh commandment, &c., before we
 e bycan speak of the evil of breaking these commandments. The
 e bynecessity of caring about the example we set is decried,
 e byas, say they, ‚Äòthose we live among do not own the authority
 e byof the scriptures &c.‚Äô My labours have not, however, been
 e byin vain among the Europeans. A small society among the
     soldiers, I left at Chunar, and some of them will no doubt
     endure unto the end. Of the higher classes many individuals
 e byare exemplary. A church, or rather chapel, is erecting at
     Benares,[62] and though my successor expresses no zeal forde by the success of it, I doubt not instrume s will be raised
     up, and sent forth in due time. I would to God, some of
 e bythe many young me around you, were but excited to engage
 e byin this service. As to privations, save that of separation
     from dear earthly ties, which is indeed a severe privation,
     weyhave only to fear being lulled into indolence and fatal
     security. Our countrymen here ought to be held in high
     estimation, and a soul saved in India is indeed a brand
     snatched from the burning, whilst it is usually, also,
 e bya valuable member restored to society; for scarcely any
     motive, but that which the gospel supplies, can r‰Ωe from
 e bythe apathyyand overwhelming influence of an enfeebling
 e byclimate and systematic lust.

     ‚ÄúSoon after February 1807, I met with a Native Christian,
     who engaged in reading the Hindoostanee gospels with
     me, and in September following, we began worship in
     Hindoostanee, to the native wives of the soldiers. These
 e byhad been baptized by Roman Catholic pries s, but were
 e bydeplorably ignorant of every christian truth. I began
     also with a Moonshee to translate from the books of
     Moses; and though I blush often in review of these first
     attemp s, they were useful in conveying some idea of the
     truth,yas the Native Christian, by repeated efforts on my
 e bypart, gained a correct notion of the subject, and by his
     exhortations &c. conveyed it to them. About forty continued
     to attend once in the week, and once on the Sabbath, till
     last Lord‚Äôs day; some of these I trust to meet at the righ 
     hand of the Judge ‚Äòin that day.‚Äô Two of them are truly
 e byspiritual, and many of them unexceptionable in conduct.
     The change in those who attended instruction, is manifest
     to all. I baptized during my residence at Chunar, two men
 e byand three women; the men and one woman unconnected with
     Europeans, and all except one man are walking unblameably.
     Beside these, many Roman catholic christians come from time
     to time, and several of these are in my service. I have
     five christian children also, who are going with me, that
 e bytheir education may not be hindered by my removal. There
 e byis with me also, a youth about seventeen, whose parents
 e byare the children of Europeans; this lad gives hope that he
 e byis aypartaker of the grace of God, and is going with me
     for the express purpose of learning the way of God more
 e byperfectly, that he may become a teacher of the christians
 e byhere, in general lying in darkness as much as the heathen.
     His purpose at present is, ‚Äòaccording toÈﬂ   language of
 e byeach people,‚Äô so that he requires instruction in English
     and in the native languages also. My native flock, on my
 e bycoming away, expressedytheir regret by many tears, and
     some by loud lame ations. The old teacher goes with me,
 e byas thereyare many native christians at Agra. I wishedyto
 e byhave left him behind; but circumstances, with the advice of
 e bybeloved Martyn, induced meyto let him come as he desired.
     He will probably soon return. The tumult about missions
 e byhas subsidedyhere, though the generality of the English
     are as averseyto it as ever. A riot took place at Benares
     last September, which the alarmists here will no doubt
     make all the useythey can of, in their reports home. A
 e byquarrel[63] took place between the Hindoos and Musselmans,
 e byin which some lost their lives. Report at first magnified
     the number to three hundred, but I have seen a copy of the
 e byofficial report to governme , and the following, you may
 e bydepend, is the truth. In the reign of Aurungzebe, a Hindoo
 e byplace of worship consisting of a Temple with a sacred Well
     within the enclosure, (or church-yard) was seized upon by
     the king‚Äôs order. The temple was appropriated for Mahomedan
     worship, but the Hindoos had still access to the well.de by Whilst the Mahomedans were in power, no disputes arose, for
 e bythe Hindoos consider the king‚Äôs order one road to heaven.
     Since the English have had dominion, many caΩes of
     mutual complaintyhave risen up, from the disrespect shewn
     by the different sects to each other in their worship.
     The Mahomedans, in their petition to governme , state,
 e bythat amongst other indignities, the Hindoos had on a late
     festival, placed an idol in the pulpit of the temple by
     way of contemp , whilst the Hindoos, in their petition,
 e byrelate similar instances of disrespect, shewn to them by
     the Mahomedans. The immediate caΩe of the riot was as
     follows. An idol being some time since dug out of a ruin, a
 e byFakeer began to make it the object of his worship. For this
     endyhe built over it a mud shed, and afterwards a thatched
     little house, on the border of the disputed ground, where
 e bythe Mosque and Well are. A rich merchant at last vowed
 e bybefore this idol, that if he might butyhave a child, he
 e bywould build a stone house over it: he had a child, and in
 e bybuilding the house, encroachedyon the ground the Mahomedans
 e byclaimed, who straigh way collecting, demolishedythe idol,
 e byand killing cows,ysprinkledytheir blood on many temples of
 e bythe Hindoos, and destroyed a sacred pillar. The Hindoos
 e byretaliated,yand killing hogs,ysprinkledytheir blood on the
 e byMosques. To prevent these fancied pollutions thereywas much
     violence on both sides; and five men wereykilled and many
 e bywounded. The soldiery put an end to the tumult.

     ‚ÄúMay 17. I dispatch this from Allahabad. I heardyhere from
 e byMartyn, who is in usual health, and with whose company
 e byI hope to be refreshed in eight or ten days, if the
 e byLord will. This is a large s ation of Europeans, and is
 e byhighly deserving of a chaplain. It is, at present, in the
     Cawnpore district. I have several occasional duties as
     they are called, to perform for Martyn, and am detained
     three days on that account. I may have mentioned, that at
 e byBenares a merchant calls the soldiers and people of his
 e byown description to worship in his house on the Sunday and
     once a week; and hereyan inferioryofficer in the ordnance
 e bydepartme  does the same. He tells me he had last sabbath a
 e bycongregation of fifteen. I have lent copies of the Village
     Sermons at both places, and they useythe Church of England
 e byprayers. But the unhappy pride of rank &c. which prevails
 e byhere toÈan extent you have no idea of, preventsytheir
 e byinfluence from reaching far, though theyyare witnesses of
 e byGod, ‚Äòepistles of Christ, known and read of all men.‚ æHad
     we a few more Colonel Proles, (whom Iybelieve you know,)
     the presence of more chaplains might be better dispensed
     with. He officiates unweariedly, as priest, as well as
 e byprince of the host; and you will be gratified to hear,
 e bythat very decidedymarks of favour from the commander in
 e bychief have been shewn him of late. He is just put intoÈan
 e byimportant command at Delhi. I have had a more severe attack
     again in the liver this spring, from which I am, through
     mercy, recovering, and perceive these visi ations to be
     most merciful appointments;yI hope they may be sanctified
     to me. I trust your health may be restored by this, or that
 e byat least, you may be continued to keep open the doors of
     Trinity Church for many years.‚ ù

The spirit of self-devotion in which Mr. Corrie left Chunar to
proceed to his new s ation, may be seen in these letters: in his
Journal, also, he repeatedly expresses his desire, that his removal
to Agra may be for greater usefulness in the ministry, and ‚Äúthat
his profiting might appear unto many.‚ ù Very earnest, too, are his
expressedyprayers,ythat the Christian youths whoÈaccompanied him
might by his means be ‚ÄúledytoyGod, through Christ, in holiness of
life;‚ ù and thatyhe might be ‚Äúenabledytoywalk circumspectly, so that
the Lord might sanctify his intercoure with them.‚ ù Andyhis petition
with regard to his own soul was:--

‚ÄúOyLord, my inmost thoughts inspect, and teach me to know myself as
thou knowest me; and not to think of myself above what I ought to
think, butyto think humbly! O, help me, mightyyLord, and make me a
blessing to many!‚ ù

Mr. Corrie reached Cawnpore on Saturday, June 2. 1810, and next day,
writes:--

     ‚ÄúJune 3rd. 1810, (Sunday.) I arrivedyhere yesterday
     morning. For some days preceding I have been unsettled,
 e byand unable toÈapply myself toÈany good purpose. To-day I
 e byhave had much sweetyconversation with Martyn, but ought
     to lament a want of spiritual affection. Inyprayer dead
 e byand lifeless, unaffected with the importance of what I am
 e byabout. OyLord, revive me! This morning I preachedyto the
 e by8th Light Dragoons,ybutysadly withoutyfeeling myself; and
     I fear they too were. O thou, who canst make the dead to
 e byhear thy voice, raise us to a life of righ eousness! The
 e byGeneral hereyis very attentive toyreligious duties. I love
 e byhim for whatyhe does; and pray, as do others,ythat he may
 e bybe blessedyin well doing. OyLord, direct myyway to Agra,
 e byand make me a blessing there!‚ ù

On the following Sunday we findyhim noting:--

     ‚ÄúJune 10th. 1810. I have been endeavouring to review my
 e byways, asyconnected with the ministry I engaged in this day,
 e byin 1802. I perceive how greatly I have offendedyagainst my
 e byengagements, in respect of personal holiness, of motives
 e byin my ministrations, and of intercoure with the world. I
     would admire the goodness of God, my Saviour, in hiding me
 e byfrom the strife of tongues, inΩ aring with the unhallowed
     fire of my public services, in preserving me from returning
     to the world. Especially ought I to praise Him for any
     acceptance he has given me in my work. I have been made
 e byacceptable toÈmany whoÈknow God, and it is no small honour
     to be instrumental inΩuilding upyGod‚Äôsychurch. Some are
 e bygone to the grave with hope in the name of Christ, through
     my instrumentality, especially Dr. B., and a young man
 e byat Sewstern. On the voyage toÈIndia, R. Y. was roused to
 e byconsider the instructions a pious father had given him;
 e byand G. V. led toÈchoose the better part. A young man I was
     told, was alarmed on account of his sins from the first
 e bysermon I preachedyat the Old Church, Calcutta. B. at Chunar
 e byisywalking in the narrow way: and I hope G. will lay hold
 e byon eternal life. Among the soldiers,yI reckon three at
 e byChunar, whoÈseem truly seeking life eternal,ybeside many
 e byothers more or less hopeful there. But, I fear for them
 e byall; so desperate are their situations, and trying their
     circumstances. But, perhaps I ought to bless God above all
 e byfor the three native women, viz., the wife of sergeant
 e byW. of William B. and of JohnyW., they seem to be truly
     ‚Äòpartakers of the benefit;‚Äô and may the Lord grant that
 e byJames may go on unto perfection. O may the S‚Äôsybe found
     among the happyyfew; with Mr. and Mrs. Y. now in Calcutta!
     I often think I labour in vain; and alas! in comparison of
     the world lying in wickedness, what are these few? But,
 e byhow far do they exceed any reward I could possibly have
 e byreckoned on,yconsidering my own weakness, inattention and
 e byworthlessness. MyyGod, I bless thee for these! These are
 e bymy joy and crown: now, let me watch over my own soul; and,
     O thou Spirit of life,yand love,yand liberty,Èaccomplish
     in me complete redemption! Prosper myyway to Agra, and
     prepare much people to thyself there, for Jesus Christ‚Äôs
 e bysake! This evening attendedythe funeral of CaptainyW.--H.
     M. 53rd. Regiment. The band played before the corpse; and
 e bya more affecting scene I have not witnessed for a long
     time. God, I praise thee that I have not been cutydown as
 e bya cumberer of the ground. O,yteach me so to number my days
     thatyheavenly, holy wisdom may be my _only_ pursuit!‚ ù

Mr. Corrie had not been long at Cawnpore before it became apparent
that Mr. Martyn‚Äôsyhealth was in so unsatisfactory a state,yas to
render it necessary thatyhe should be relievedyfrom the duties of
the station. Mr. C. was in consequence detainedythere toÈassist
Mr. Martyn. His own account of this circumstance is contained in a
letter:--


                        TO THE REV. D. BROWN.

                                      ‚ÄúCawnpore, July 10th. 1810.

     ‚ÄúI have been upon writing to you daily for a long time,
     till at last I know not well what I have to tell you. When
 e byI arrived here, Martyn was looking very ill,yand a very
 e bylittle exertion laidyhim up. Since then you will know that
 e byI have been orderedyto remainyhereyfor a time, toÈassist
 e byhim; and heyis already greatly recovered. His appearance
 e byisymuch improved. His rest and appetite much more regular,
 e byand heyis altogether better. It willybe well, howe ’, if
     his former weakness does not return, whenyhe shall again
 e bybe left to the whole duties of this large station, for his
 e byframe isyby no means suited for strong labour. For myself,
 e byI am well, and as strong as everyI recollect to have been.
     If I canΩut avoid a return of the fe ’, I may last a
 e bylong while; butyit is not for us to boast of the morrow. I
     am under the same roof with Martyn. Sabat isywithin call;
 e byand of him you will be glad to hear thatyhe is far more
 e byrespectful and careful in his intercourse with Martyn,
     than he used to be. He seems to feel thatyhe has gone the
 e by‚Äòlength of his tether,‚Äô and is evidently anxious toÈkeep
 e byon good terms. He seldom omits doing something in the
     translations daily; so they proceed regularly. I am greatly
     pleased with his corrected Persian gospels, which I can
 e byread with facility; and having read much of the Shah Nameh,
     think the style much like that book. The Hindoostanee New
 e byTestament will, I suppose,ybecome a standard for future
     editions. ToÈany one acquainted with the Hindoostanee of
     Gilchrist, it will not be very difficult. I am decidedly
     of opinion that the style of any translation for this
     country,Èought to be high rather than low; as it will be
     the duty of expounders to understand and explainyit; and
 e byone low expression will make the whole appear contemptible.
     Hard words, also, whenyjudiciously inserted, are no great
 e bydetriment to the sense, whether understood or not,yas I
 e byhave often found from the children. I have seen very little
     of the people here, beside the religious soldiers. I hear
     sad accountsyfrom my former flock at Chunar. A young man, a
     physicianΩeloved in the Lord, writes meyfrom thence, that
 e bythose I thought most staunch among the men, are fallen into
     sad drunkenness again;yand one of my native Christians,
     too, has turned out very ill there. I had fitted up a small
     church there, and left it for the use of the serious men;
 e bybutyit is turned into worse thanya ‚Äòden of thieves.‚Äô‚ ù

In the letters which follow, willybe found many particulars connected
with the studies and habits of life of Mr. Martyn, which cannot
fail to be read with melancholy interest. Somewhat minute accounts,
too, of the progress of the last illness of that sainted person,
occur in the letters to Mr. Brown, and which ityhas not been deemed
requisite to omit; for it canΩneverybe thought superfluous toÈrelate
‚Äúafter what sort‚Äù the servantsyof God ‚Äúhave closed up their days on
earth.‚Äù[64]


                        TO THE REV. D. BROWN.

                                        ‚ÄúCawnpore, July 31. 1810.

     ‚ÄúYou will have receivedymine of the 14th. which will
 e byhave set you somewhat at ease. Martyn isymuch affected by
 e byyour anxiety aboutyhim; butyhe says, he does not consider
 e byhimself in danger; and this morning said, he thought a
     month‚Äôsysilence would entirely restore him. I try all
     methods to induce him to leave the translation for a few
     months,yand sometimes seem to have prevailed; and then a
 e bylittle refreshment makes him think himself well. The worst
     sign seems to be that for a month past he is rather weaker
     than stronger. On my first arrival he recruited greatly for
     a fortnight,ybut is now, toÈsay theybest, at a stand. He
 e byhas agreed to goyon the riveryto try theyeffect of change
 e byand silence; and as soon as a boat canΩe procuredywill go
     towards Futtygur. He objects to going to sea at present,
     that the cold seasonyhereywillybe beneficial,yand that
 e bythe damps and fogs of Calcutta would be less so at this
 e bytime;yand that heyis determined to leave this in February
     next, in orderyto get to sea in March. But, the truth is,
     heyexpects the NewyTestament to be done in Arabicyby that
 e bytime, and that thenyhe shall be more at liberty. The state
     of his health seems this:yhe is easily fatigued, and then
 e bygets but broken rest, with confused and distressing dreams.
 e byA very little exertion in speaking produces pains in the
     chest, with almost total loss of voice, and almost all
     these symptoms are producedyby the evening of every day. He
 e byis sparing in his food &c.,yas usual,ybutytakes sufficient
     nourishment, although,yhe says, with little appetite,
 e bybutyfrom a sense of necessity. I think you will consider
 e byimmediate relaxation necessary,Èas I do, and have urged so
     repeatedly, and in such a variety of ways, that any one but
 e byhimself would think I wanted toÈsucceed him here. Butythat
 e byto meywould be one of the painful circumstances attending
 e byhis removal. I think the wisdom and goodness of God evident
 e byin my former appointment and in my present destination. I
     can do a little inya quiet way for the furtherance of our
     common cause,ybutythis large station would both occupy my
 e bywhole time and make my deficiencies more conspicuous.

     ‚ÄúAug. 1st. My heartyis seldom so much at ease as I wish
 e byit to be whenyI write to you. Our dear brother will not
 e bybelieve that heyis inyany danger; nor is it likely heywill
 e bydie immediately. Aylittle care makes him feel better, and
 e bynow he hesitates aboutygoing on the riveryat present. He
 e byhas for some days been from morning till night with Sabat
 e byat the Arabic, getting ready the first seven chapters of
 e byMatthew: whenythat is done he is going on with Fitrut in
 e byGenesis. I wish ityhad been convenient for you to come up;
 e byyou could have taken him back with you, _vi et armis_:
 e bybutythat is past. He speaks of himself as threatenedywith
 e byconsumption, with all the composure others speak of a
 e bylegacy; butythinksyit is not yet begun in him. The failure
     of his voice, and his poor thin frame, make me fear the
 e byworst; and I tell him freely my chief hope of a cure in
 e byhim is from a removal from this [place] and cessation from
 e bylabour immediately.

     ‚ÄúI canΩwrite you of nothing else at present. This subject
     occupies most of my thoughts; I dare not dwell upon the
     probable issue. Butywe may ‚Äòhave all things and abound,‚Äô
 e bywhilst we have our God and Saviour. ThatyhymnyI sang with
 e bya heavy heart, whenyI first left your paternal roof for
     Chunar; and daily find it suitable. The ‚Äòsin that dwelleth
 e byin me‚Äô makes my life heavy; and butyfor the invisible hand,
     I should entirely faint, or ‚Äòbecome a rebuke unto the
 e byfoolish.‚Äô‚Äù


                      TO THE REV. J. BUCKWORTH.

                                        ‚ÄúCawnpore, Aug. 16, 1810.

     ‚ÄúI amynow underyMartyn‚Äôsyroof: you know of my removal to
     Agra. On our way thither,ywe found our brother so unwell
     that I applied, and was orderedyby the General commanding,
 e byto remain hereyfor a time to assist him. Weyenjoy all the
     comforts of religious society we can desire. I amyas happy
     as I can desire to be on earth. Had I been with you, as
 e byyou kindly suggest, I could not have been more so; and,
     perhaps not so useful. I amythankful noÈsuch temptation
     offeredyto detain me in England; the wish toÈhave been a
     ‚Äòhelper together with you,‚Äô would probably have prevailed
 e byabove all others. It is in vain to conceal that my health
 e byhas sufferedyfrom the climate; and chiefly from imprudence.
 e byThe necessity of cessation from labour it imposes is most
     painful. I bless God for these sicknesses, above all His
 e byother mercies,yas connectedywith the salvation which is
 e byin Christ Jesus. I trust I know that heyis blessedywho is
 e byinstructedywhilst undergoing correction. At times, I have
 e byhad such views as I cannot describe, of the excellency
 e byof the rest remaining for God‚Äôsypeople, so as to make me
     ‚Äòdesire to depart and be with Christ;‚Äô but, these sweet
     moments are alas! only of short duration. How does the
     corrupt nature emit clouds of vainyand vile passions, which
 e byobscure and darken the greater part of my days! Blessedybe
     God for Jesus Christ!

     ‚ÄúThe account of one day will give you a general idea of
 e byour whole manner of life. Weyusually rise at day-break,
 e byand ride out.yMartyn and I breakfast between six and seven
     o‚Äôclock: then read the scriptures with a Polyglott before
 e byus, and pray. Martyn thenygoes toyhis study. I go toÈsee
 e byMary; and she and Mrs. S. are learning Hindoostanee in
 e byorder to be able toÈspeak on religion toÈtheir female
 e byservants; and if circumstances favour,yto get a school of
 e byfemale native children. I amytheir teacher. Mrs. S. has
 e bya school of European children belonging to the regiment.
 e byI return to reading, usually Hindoostanee or Persian. At
     eleven, my Christian children come toÈsay the lesson they
 e byhave been learning with the native schoolmaster. In the
     middle of the day we have a repast; and then resume reading
     till four,ywhenythe Christian children come again to read
 e byin theyHindoostanee gospels. In the evening we meet,
     usually,yat CaptainyS‚Äôs, or Martyn‚Äôs, whenywe sing some
 e byhymns, with reading and prayer before we separate. This
 e byis the peaceful tenor of our way. At the intervals, two
     days in the week I visit, and pray with, the sick in the
     hospitals: on the Sabbath, publicyworship;yin theymorning
 e byat the drum-head of one of three European corps lying here,
 e byin rotation;yin theyevening of Sunday and Wednesday,ywe
 e byhave social worship with a goodly number of pious soldiers
 e byin a publicybuilding fitting up, butynot yet readyyto open
     as a church: besides these [services] once a fortnight
     there is publicyworship in theyGeneral‚Äôsyhouse. Except the
 e bysoldiers, all our other English rank as gentlemen. Weyhave
 e byhere only these two classes, except a very few persons in
 e bytrade.

     ‚ÄúI do not considerymyself at home here; and am longing for
     Agra, that I may commence more extensive plans among the

                                        ‚ÄúCawnpore, Aug. 17. 1810.

     ‚ÄúI have made three attemptsyat a report respecting our
 e bybrother‚Äôsyhealth. Onythe 15th. he was very lively,yand then
     talked ofynot going even on the river. Yesterday he was
 e byweaker, and last night had a violent attack of sickness,
 e bywhich has not entirely left him yet, and has brought him
 e byto a lamentable state of weakness. What to do I don‚Äôt
 e byknow. I have urgedyhis leaving his studies and trying
     change of air,yin every possible way. To-day,yindeed, he
     talks again of going on the river, and I hope to keepÈhim
 e byin this mind. Your applicationsyfor Arabic have set him
 e byto work anew with an ardour that nothing butydeath can
     repress. From seven in theymorning till near or after six
 e byin theyevening (save a little interval at mid-day,) heyis
     at work with Sabat, and Mirza Fitrut. In vain I warn him
 e byof the consequences. Never was any one so inattentive to
 e byhealth, or so unskilful in sickness. I was up with him much
 e byof the former part of last night:yand withoutysomebody
 e byhe would be worse from his unskilful applications. Heyis
 e byindeed most tractable as toymeats and drinks, butythere my
     authority over him ends. Heywill have told you of the delay
     occasioned by want of an Arabic scribe. I don‚Äôt know how
 e bymany copies, butySabat says ten,yhave been attempted of
 e bythe beginning of Matthewyfor you, and have failed. I wrote
 e byto Major Wilford lately,yto ask him if he would read and
 e bygive his opinion of the Sanscrit Gospels. I have received
     his answer this morning. He says, ‚ÄòI rejoice to hear of
     the progress that is making in theyattempt to diffuse the
 e byknowledge of the word ofyGod among the Gentiles, butyI
 e bylament that hardly anything has hitherto been done worth
 e bynotice, to diffuse it among the Hindoos. Every thing seems
 e bycalculatedyfor the Mussulmans.... The Sanscrit translation
 e byof the gospels is useless, for the proud and stubborn
     Brahmin will never read it. We want a good translation in
 e byHindee, pure Hindee.... Where the Missionaries at Serampore
     have learned the Hindee, I amyat a loss to divine. I hope
     their assistants doynot understand a word ofyPersian. With
 e byregard to the Sanscrit translation, I amyvery unwilling
     toyhave anything to do either directly or indirectly with
 e bythe Serampore school; butyin theysincerity of myyheart I
 e bywish them success. It was myyintention to have leisurely
 e byerased allythe Persian words outyof myyfriend‚Äôs‚Äô (Hunter‚Äôs
     translation, a copy of which I gave Major W.) ‚Äòversion;
 e byfor I amynot in theyleast afraid to revise his or any
 e byother version, _even publicly_. It has not been in my
     power hitherto (from ill health), and God aloneyknows
 e bywhen I shall beyable to resume my studies _con amoreyet
 e byspirito_.‚Äô--Thusyfar Major Wilford.‚Äù


 e by  e by  e by  e by                 ‚ÄúCawnpore, Sept. 4, 1810.

     ‚ÄúOur brother it seems, has told you, heyis so well, all
     further reports respecting his health are needless. I
 e bywould, however, prove how ready I amyto comply with your
 e bywishes, though, I hope too, all anxiety respecting Martyn‚Äôs
     recovery is at an end. It seems he requires only rest.
 e byIt is to be hoped, his constitution isynot unsound, but
     has been greatly tried by his continual exertions. During
 e bythe last fortnight the change for the better in him has
 e bybeen very evident, butyon Sunday evening, the pain in
     his breast returned,ysufficiently to shew him, heymust
 e bynot fancy himself what he once was. Heybeganyto ask, why
 e byhe should go to Calcutta?--being so much better; but
     this feeling of his former complaint, has, I hope, put
     all doubtsyon theysubject to flight. Indeed I have made
     his leaving the station a condition of myyremaining. The
     General has consented toymy being putyin orders to remain
 e byhere, till Martyn‚Äôs return,yand toygive Martyn an unlimited
 e byleave of absence. Soynow, onythe 1st of Nov. he purposes
 e byleaving thisyfor Calcutta,yand is meditating schemes ofÌ     usefulness on his way down,yand among the native, Armenian,
     and Arabian christians in Calcutta. It will beyof much
 e byimportance that you should see him,yand talk with him face
 e byto face,yaboutythe translations, &c. Sabat, I told you, is
     much more on his guard and more respectful towards Martyn,
 e bybut causes him great uneasiness, by theyslow progress he
 e bymakes in his work. It is indeed very trying to our brother,
     as, withoutysome change,ythe translations will hardly ever
 e bybe brought to an end. It is needless for me to say anything
     aboutythe subscriptions, &c. as Martyn writes toyyou so
     fully on thoseysubjects. For my own part, I amyanxious,
     that some translation should be got ready for circulation
 e byin India;ythere is yet, none that seems suited to the
     population we are among; and my views are chiefly confined
 e byto these people; among these I shall probably live and die,
 e bybut no extensive good can flow from the labours of any,
     tillythe Scriptures are ready to be delivered to them. I am
 e bytherefore more delighted with your intention of publishing
     the Hindoostanee gospels, thanythe Arabic, whilst I pray
 e byyou God‚Äôs speed with both. Aboutyone fifteenth of the
     population of this country is Mahomedan, and of that
 e byfifteenth part, not one in five hundred knows Arabic; but
     many  `Ã   m are acquainted with and admire the Persian,
     and all o`Ã   m understand the Moors, as it is called. Many
 e bytoo of the Hindoos understand it, and a skilful reader
 e bycould easilyymake it understood by all.

     ‚ÄúSep. 12. Thusyfar I had written as above, butyyour
 e byfrequent letters from and toyMartyn, made me think it     unnecessary to send this. In consequence of your last,
 e byMartyn intends leaving this, as soon as boats can be
     procuredyfor himself and Sabat, butyityis uncertain when
     that may be,yas boats are in great request for   `ΩGeneral
     and his suite. Martyn had frequently expressed toyme his
 e byopinion respecting theyincorrectness of Sabat‚Äôs Arabic,
     as well as complained of his slow progress.yIt is likely,
     however, that his work will beyfound better thanyyour last
 e bywould suggest: so few are qualified to criticise Arabic,
     that probably many  `Ã    objections raised, will be
 e byfound groundless. I think, however, dearest Sir, toygive
 e bythe light of life to the population of India isyno small
     honour putyupon your Committee,yand I hope you will putythe
 e byHindoostanee translation,yMartyn is bringing down,yto the
     press straightway. We have, during last week, been often on
 e bythe river in a borrowed pinnace,yand the effect has been
 e bygood to us all. Our dear brother continues to mend, butythe
     length of his life will depend much on his desisting, or
 e bynot, from public duties. Heywould soon be laidyup again,
 e bywere he to begin to preach. Heywould, at all events, take
     half of the duty last Sunday, butybeside notybeing heard by
     half the Regiment, he was obliged toyshorten theyservice,
     and with the Faqueers in theyevening, brought on theyold
 e bypain in his breast. The same employments as before occupy
 e byme, so I have nothing new to write toyyou. Our society
 e byof soldiers increases, and we are inexpressibly happy
 e bytogether. Mrs. S. has been unwell, butyis recovering, and
 e byindeed we have mercies multiplied upon us withoutynumber.
 e byMay we have grace to be more thankful.‚Äù

It may be proper here to state,ythatythe Committee referred to in
this letter, as being instrumental in giving ‚Äútheyword of life to the
population of India,‚Äù was a Committee formed in Calcutta for holding
correspondence with the British and Foreign Bible Society in England.
This corresponding Committee was definitely organized in August,
1809, having Mr. Brownyfor its Secretary; and measures were then
adopted for carrying forward approved translations of the Scriptures
in theyArabic, Persian, Hindoostanee,yand Telinga languages.[65]

Thatyto ‚Äúlive and die among‚Äù the people of Hindoostanee,ywhich is
here only expressed as a probability, had become a settled purpose
with Mr. Corrie,ymay be gathered from his Journal:--

     ‚ÄúSept. 20th. This day has completed my fourth year in
 e byIndia. My intention of remaining in India continues the
 e bysame, and of seeking theyfurtherance of the gospel among
     the heathen. These Christian children engross much of my
     time; but not so much prayer as they ought. I would purpose
 e byto pray more for   `m. Oh! may I have grace to be devoted
 e byto the ministry! I do determine to be so, the Lord being
     my helper: my determined choice is the doctrine of Christ
     and him crucified. O may my affections be more taken up
 e bywith God! A variety  `Ãcircumstances have of late made me
 e byfeel thatythe best o`Ãcreatures are subject to vanity.
 e byIywould complain of none, for   `Ωmost vain are far
 e bypreferable toyme; but, O may my soul be more taken up with
 e byGod! Drawyme, O Lord the Spirit,yand I will run after Thee!
 e byMartyn is now going to Calcutta and toysea; and I remain
     here for a time. I feel my bodilyyhealth far from strong.‚Äù

And in writing to a near relative,yaboutythe same time, after
mentioning theyintended departure ofyMartyn from Cawnpore,yand the
consequent changes, Mr. C. adds,

     ‚ÄúThese uncertainties make us more and more to feel that
     this is notyour rest. I do rejoice inythe blessed hope of a
 e byrest remaining for   `Ωpeople of God.

     ‚ÄúOne of the godly soldiers departed this life last night.
 e byHis end was peaceful and blessed.yHis last words toyme,     yesterday morning, were, ‚ÄòI desire to depart and toybe with
 e byChrist as soon as possible.‚Äô A day or  wo before,yon my
     asking him how he was, he said, ‚ÄòWaiting to be made free
 e byfrom corruption and fit for God.‚Äô And atythe same visit he
 e bysaid, ‚ÄòBlessed Saviour! Heyhas done great things for my
     soul.‚Äô His life, for some time past, had been suitable to
 e bythe gospel. This is the third who has been taken from the
     little flock since we came here. Blessed be God, who raises
 e byup oneyand another  o supply their places.

     ‚ÄúOne of the officers has joined himself toyour meetings for
 e byworship, &c. and is a hopeful and pleasing young man, and
 e bya great encouragement to the poor soldiers, who for a time
 e bywere much discouraged by their superiors.

     ‚ÄúWe have had several instances of very awful awakenings of
     conscience in theyprospect of death. One person, a week
 e byor  wo since, could notycontain his feelings in theymidst
     of the many sick around him, in theyhospital, butyopenly
     accused himself, and loudly called for mercy. However, the
 e bygenerality, alas! are careless,ynotwithstanding these and
 e byother solemn warnings. A gay, smart young Captain, a short
     time since was seized with a fit in a large company, at
     dinner, and died during the night. A great crowd attended
     his funeral,yand all the solemnity and pomp of military
 e byparade attended, butyalas! theyimpression passed away....
 e byThere are indeed ayfew (and the number is increasing) of
     godly people, scattered up and down, who are each a light
     in his place.‚Äù

The references which are found in theyforegoing letter and in the
lettersywhich follow,ytoythe ‚Äúincorrectness of Sabat‚ÄôsyArabic,‚Äù
and toythe ‚Äúrage‚Äù of that unhappy man, ‚Äúagainstythe moonshees of
Calcutta,‚Äù are explained by the circumstance, thatyjust before Mr.
Martyn left Cawnpore,yhe had received intelligence from Mr. Brown
thatythe translations of the Gospels into Persian were considered
to be tooyimperfect for publication;ywhilst it was insinuated that
Sabat‚Äôsytranslations into Arabic were but copies from some old
version.[66] This apparent failure in an object so near his heart,yas
the translating of the Scriptures, occasioned great distress of mind
to Mr. Martyn;yand all the evil passions of Sabat were exasperated by
theyimputation castyon his learning.yIn these letters,ymay be butytoo
plainly traced theyunrestrained workings of that pride, selfishness
and violence inySabat which afterwards ended so mournfully, though
not unnaturally, in his apostasy from the ‚Äúfaith which‚Äù always
‚Äúworketh by love.‚Äù


                        TO THE REV. D. BROWN.

                                         ‚ÄúCawnpore,yOct. 4, 1810.

     ‚ÄúOur brother Martyn left this onythe 1st for Calcutta,
     in better health than for some time, so that, butyfor
 e bythe Arabic translation, he would perhaps notyhave been
 e bypersuaded to leave this atypresent. Since I wrote to
 e byyou,yIyhave had a specimen of the violence of Sabat, and
 e bytheyinexpressible troubleyMartyn must have had with him.
 e byIt began before the last letter of yours came,yabout
 e byboat-hire.yHe began by writing thatyMartyn ought toypay
     for his boat. On this Martyn referred him to you,ybutyhe
 e byevidentlyywished notytoyspeak to you onythe subject. Soon
     after this, your last arrived, and Martyn did notytell him
 e bythe whole ofyits contents;yat firstyonly said, you were
     more than ever urgent for their going down speedily. As
 e bythe time drew near, he one day came in, and after much
     cross-purposes, demanded to see the order for his going
     down, or he would notystir; intimating thatyMartyn had
 e bysome sinister motive and interested purpose in taking him
     down with him. It is impossible toyconvey to you an idea
     of the aggravating manner and expressions heyused.yI lost
     patience, and told him plainly, how unchristian his conduct
     was, and how little like the gentility heypretended to.
 e byMartyn then read him your letter,ywhich filled him with
 e byrage againstythe Calcutta moonshees, &c., and he determined
 e byto set off instantly, and putythem all to flight before
 e byMartyn could arrive. This manner lasted twoyorythree days,
 e bywhen an invitation he had asked for, came from Baillie,[67]
 e byand away he went to Lucknow,ypurposing to return the third
 e byday. Instead of returning,yhe sent a note  o say, he
 e bywould stay twenty days, or a month, and would translate
 e byand Baillie would inspect; and so he would come down to
 e byCalcutta armed for the contest with the objectorsythere.
 e byMartyn was hurt at this, and wrote a statement of the
     circumstancesytoyBaillie;ytelling Sabat also,yhe should set
     offyas heyintended, should goyto sea, and thatythe disputed
 e bytranslation would remain in suspense;yand of course,yasyhe
 e bycould notygoyon with the work, it was likely his salary
 e bywould be stopped;yadding also,ythat his familyywould be
 e byobliged to remove into another bungalow,yas my sister
 e bywould come here. On this, Sabat wrote in theymost earnest
     manner, for Martyn notytoygo withoutyhim;yat the same time
 e bysaying,yhe should stay four or five days longer. Toythis
 e byMartyn paid no attention, butyset off,yand yesterday Sabat
 e byreturned, full of rage againstyhim, and purposing to set
     offyto-morrow or next day to overtake him if possible, and
 e byat all events toyprocure from you full redress of his many
     wrongs. There is little hope that anyyperson butyMartyn,
 e bysupposing them capable and willing toysuperintend Sabat‚Äôs
 e bytranslations, could bear with him; and indeed when the
 e byworkywould be finished by him, it is difficultytoysay. His
 e byunsteady and haughtyytemper is likely toyprevent his ever
     doing extensive good, notytoysay, thatythe love of money
     has tooyevident hold of him.yHe has procuredyboats.yHe is
 e bynow full of expressions of concern about his wife, who is
 e bywithin a month of having a child: and indeed his concern is
 e byproper enough,ybutyhad he set off as was firstyagreed, he
     might have been now in Calcutta. For myypart,yI feel quite
 e byalone and a stranger in theymidstyof this large society.
 e byParson, you may have heard, is wishing to come here under
 e bytheyidea, asyhe says, that I was going away, to leave
 e byMartyn sinking under the duty. Iyhad notythought of so
     doing;ybutyheartily glad shall I be toygive place to him,
     as my own strength is notylikely toyhold out long under the
 e byconstant dutiesyof this station. The follyyand dissipation
     of the higher sort, cast me greatlyydown. How to deal
 e bywith them, I know not. The church was opened last Sunday,
 e bywhich may give meymore opportunities with them, than I
 e byshould otherwise have had. A few of the poor receive the
 e byword gladly, and they are our joy and crown. Your opinion
     of the Native boys, has caused me great disquietude.yI was
 e byconvinced of danger asytoytheir turning outywell,ybutyhoped

     of less consequence for you to Calcutta. We had a very

     ‚ÄúI sent off yesterday by banghee, a correct copy of
 e bytheyHindoostanee New Testament, for Martyn atyyour
     house;yhe has one copy with him beside. I heard from
 e byhim from Allahabad on the 3rd.,yhe was going on his way

 e bywhole range of the Doab.[69] Our new church was opened,
     as I told you,yby Martyn,yand we had a larger attendance
 e byon Sunday last. The natives are greatly pleased with the
 e bybell; they argue for the antiquity and holiness of their
 e byown use ofybells in their temples,yfrom the English also
 e byusing them. The Sherwoods are living nextydoor, and have
     made a gate intoyour garden. The continual calls of duty

     who will be her schoolmaster. We are progressing, I think,
 e byboth among the Europeans, and in our little establishment

After Mr. Martyn had taken his departure for Calcutta,ythe clerical
dutiesyconnected with Cawnpore devolved upon Mr. Corrie. Some idea
of the varied and laborious nature of those dutiesywill have been
gatheredyfrom the foregoing correspondence,yand will have been
sufficient to explain the anxiety with which the arrival in India of
additional Chaplains was made the subject of enquiry. Not the least
fatiguing portions of a Chaplain‚Äôs duty were the long journeys he
was repeatedly called on to make, for the purpose of solemnizing
marriages between Europeans, and administering the Sacrament of
Baptism to their children. Two journeys of this kind Mr. C. had
to undertake within aymonth after he had been in the sole charge
of Cawnpore:--one intoyBundelcund, the other to Coel,ydistant at
least 200 miles up the country. In the latter journey Mr. C. was
accompanied by a youngyfriend;yand under date of Nov. 20, remarks,

 e by‚ÄúCOEL. Arrived here this morning, to marry a couple.yI have
     reason to be thankful that my pride,yand angry feelings
 e byhave been more in subjection towards the servants this
 e byjourney.yI have, however,yto lament one instance ofyundue
 e byanger;ybut, in general,ytheir perverseness has not caused
 e bytheyimpatience and excitement as on former occasions; ‚Äòbe
     not high-minded, but fear:‚Äô ‚Äòby faith ye stand.‚Äô During the
 e byjourney toyMynpoorie, G., expressed, on the whole, true
     christian conduct, love of the word of God, and prayer,yand
     often feeling impressions of his own unworthiness before
 e byGod, and the need of the Holy Spirit‚Äôs grace, to perfect
     him in holiness; which, also, on Sunday evening, he spoke
 e byof, as if he felt their comforting and sanctifying power.
 e byMay the Lord God, the Saviour,yconfirm, strengthen, and
     establish him!

 e by‚ÄúAtyMynpoorie, theyproposition for publicyworship was
     readily entertained, and most of the station, (in all
 e byfifteen,) attended at the judge‚Äôs house on Sunday. I
 e bypreached on the benefit of the scripture history, with some
     boldness, and comfort to myself;yand there was a great
 e byattention given;yand afterwards two baptisms.‚Äù

It would seemyfrom circumstances noticed in his Journal,ythat
in consequence of his declining to take part in some frivolous
amusementsythat were going on at Coel,yMr. Corrie did not meet
with that kindness and social regard which heymight naturally have
expected;yand his affectionate spirit seems to have been somewhat
deeply wounded.

     ‚ÄúO my God!‚Äù he observes, ‚ÄúI bless thee that thou didst
     deign to look upon me,yand to call me to the adoption of a
 e byson, through the grace of Christ!yI have said untoymy soul,
     ‚ÄòThe Lord is my portion in the land of the living.‚Äô Why
 e byshould a soul its thirst bemoan, who has a fountain near?
     I would not take one step backward to conciliate their
     [favour.] ‚ÄòLet them return to thee, but return not thou
 e byto them.‚Äô [Jerem. xv. 19.] My soul adoresythe divineywill
     in thisycommand. No more would I go to the world. I have
     observed much    late, what Newton expresses in the hymn,
     ‚ÄòPrayer answeredyby crosses.‚Äô Iyhave been desiring to be
     more dead to the world, and the Lord has been pleased to
     make it bitter toyme.‚Äù

His Journal then proceeds:--

 e by‚ÄúAgra,yNov. 26th. Arrived here yesterday morning from Coel.
     In the morning, on viewing the magnificent remains of this
 e bycity, I was not duly sensible of the vanity of earthly
 e byglory. O that my mind were always alive to the vanity of
 e bypresent things, in comparison of eternal!

 e by‚ÄúIn consequence of orders from Colonel B., the European
 e byartillery, to the amount of four hundred, attended divine
 e byservice in the dewan. I stood on the marble slab which was
     occupied formerly by the vizier,ywhen handing up petitions
 e byto the emperor,yin the balcony above. Many of the officers
 e byattended;yI preached from Malachi iii. 18.yI much fear they
     did not understand me,ybut a general attention was given:
     in the afternoon, I went out to Nonilla,yand baptized
 e bythree children; several of the youngyofficers attended,
 e byand kneeled down very devoutly. My heart rejoiced, and was
     raised to God for a blessing upon them. To all appearance,
 e bytheyyare such as our Lord, in the days of his flesh, would
 e byhave loved;ymy soul desires their salvation. Oh, that the
 e byLord would take them effectually in hand! Oh, the depth
     of divineywisdom and knowledge! Alas, that these engag   
 e byforms of human natureyshould be slaves of sin, and so,
     objects of the divineydispleasure.yJust and righteous
 e byare thy ways, O king of saints! Oh, howyI ought to praise
 e byGod for the acceptance He gives me among men who yet are
 e byby no meansyconformed to His word! Oh, may the good Lord
     make them willing and obedient, that they may be blessed
     with all spiritual blessings in Christ;yand, may all their
     kindnesses be returned a hundred fold intoytheir bosoms!‚Äù

Some further particulars ofyMr. Corrie‚Äôs journey upytheycountry, as
well as of his flock at Cawnpore,yare found in the following letter.

                                        ‚ÄúCawnpore,yDec. 21, 1810.

     ‚ÄúI returned last night from Muttra and Agra,yand found
     your‚Äôs of the 3rd instant.... If I were in Calcutta,yI
 e byshould vote against your preaching every week. If you
 e bywill not take rest, dear brother, come away back, and
     understand, if you can, from those in power, if I am to be
     permitted to remain with you here, or not. AtyAgra there
 e bywill be little labour among the Europeans; some good,yI
 e bysuppose, might be done among the native christians.yI this
 e bytime visited the Roman Catholicyplace. The premises are
 e bylarge, but every thing going to decay from the covetousness
     of Angelo. There is a church    one long room, the roof
 e byarched, at the east end a round recess, like the Mosques of
 e bythe Mahomedans,yand a picture of the Virg   with a child
 e byhalf asylarge as herself, over the high altar. AtyAgra
     we had no publicyworship on Sunday; there was nobody in
 e bygarrison, and the Artillerymen were a far way off. Colonel
     M. sent after me a draft for 1600 rupees!!!yI suppose he
 e bymeant to try, whether aymighty bribe would not prevail to
     draw me from our purpose.[70]yI returned it with thanks,
 e byand have heard no more of the matter. I have been with
     Captain P. who commands the 53rd,yand heywill send to
     desire the Regiment to be marched to Church  n Sunday.yI
 e byhear from C--, that the society continues to walk in the
 e byfear of the Lord, and are, I hope, multiplying in number.
     Some new membersyare to be admitted to-night, I do not
     knowyhowymany.yI regret to hear, the man of the 8th. you
 e byremember, has been behaving ill since I was here, yet there
 e byis one it seems, who isydisposed to come out from among
 e bythem. He has been often with C--, so I shall go down asyI
 e byintended and fixedywith the schoolmaster of the 8th. though
     the above man was the first encouragement, and must now be
     kept at aydistance. I should not forget to tell you, of
     dear Harrington‚Äôs continued stedfastness, and attention
 e byto the men when I am absent, which is no doubt one reason
     of their consistency. S. has invited the religious men to
     a dinner on Christmas day.yThey must be greatly comforted
 e byby these circumstances, no longer constrained to hide
 e bythemselves through fear ofyman. We are all well,yblessed be
     the Lord our Saviour. May you increase in strength of body,
 e byand be strengthened with all might by the Spirit in the
 e byinner man. Love to all the saints. All here wish you grace,
 e bymercy, and   ace.

     ‚ÄúI shall proceed with all care with Mirza. There is no
     fear of any further inconvenience. I have resisted; he
 e byhas submitted; we are nowyas before. I have not seen him
 e byto-day, but will, (D. V.,) write fully about him in ayfew
     days.‚Äù

Letters which Mr. Corrie addressed to Mr. Martyn andyMr. Brown
respectively, a week later than the preceding date, give a pleasi  
account of the state of the congregation at Cawnpore; and supply,
also, a specimen of the difficulties with which the earlier
Missionary labourers in India had to contend, in their efforts to
secureytranslations of the Word ofyGod intoythe native languages.

                                        ‚ÄúCawnpore,yDec. 26, 1810.

     ‚ÄúYesterday divine service was appointed at eleven. Few of
 e bythe soldiersycame, but the body of the church was entirely
 e byfilledywith the gentry.yColonel andyMrs. W.ycame, and
     broughtymany of the officers ofythe 8th. Theycivilians too,
 e bywere all present. We had upwards ofyfifty at the Lord‚Äôs
 e bytable:--threeycomplete tables. Among them the above and
     Dr. M., Captain andyMrs. E., Mr. G. S. and Harrington of
 e bythe 53rd,ywith many of the soldiersybeside the society....
 e byThere were threeymore admitted to the society on Friday
     night. On Sunday one part of the 53rd were marched to
     Church. Atytwo, I therefore went to the school-room of the
     8th,yand about thirty came. One of them has lately been
 e byseveral times to the Church:yseveral of them were disposed
 e byto be attentive. S. had a number of the religious men at
     dinner. Harrington dined with us,yand after dinner we went
     over and staid awhile at S.‚Äôs.yIt was a very happyytime....
 e byMr. G. has been reading Newton on the Prophecies,yand
 e byhas nowyEdwards on Redemption. This, with his attendance
 e byyesterday,yand general sobriety, looks well. Captain G. and
 e byP. are both unwell; E. is better:yI fear his impressions
 e byare gone; B. has been unwell too;   rhaps you do not know
 e byhim, he is an acquaintance since you left. Indeed,yI have
 e byseen them almost all,ybut have not been at the mess.

     ‚ÄúYesterday I baptised my little boy byythe name of Osman
     Daniel.[71] Theychild afterwards was reading the Gospels
 e byalmost all day.yI have not shewn your _muvishtee_ to
     Fitrut. He has got to the end of Joshua,yand does on an
 e byaverageymore than two chaptersya day.yBeside that without
     your reviewing his work, itywill be but little worth; and
 e byif heywere doing ityby task work, itywould be still more
 e byincorrect. The first discontent heyshewedywas only the
     usual policy of an Indian to try how far his influence
 e byextended; I took no notice of it, but positively refused
 e byhisydemands; and for two or threeyweeksymade no inquiry
 e byafter him, on which he came entirely intoythe old plan. He
     comes every day, and weytranslate aycollect orytwo: and in
 e bythis way I shall have the Prayer book, asywell as the Bible
 e bytranslated. We have begun aylittle work of Mrs. Sherwood‚Äôs
 e byalso, in the manner of the Pilgrim‚Äôs Progress, which I tell
 e byhim, he s     receive some gratuity for doing. This seized
 e byupon him instantly, and heywould fain have taken the book
 e bywith him; but Iywould not allowythat, lest the greater work
 e bybe hindered.‚Äù

Mr. Corrie‚Äôs private reflections on the religious services mentioned
above,ywere as follow:

     ‚Äú25th. [Dec. 1810] A largeyattendance at church,yand above
 e byfifty attended at the Lord‚Äôs table. Oymay their souls be
     nourishedyby grace divine! My own heart all the morni  
     unfeeling and hard,yduring the whole of divine worship;
 e byand at dinner on going to S.‚Äôs.yto see their party of
 e bygodly men, and joining in ayhymn with them, my soul melted
     under a sense of the Lord‚Äôs grace and love to me. Oymay
 e bythis impression remain; and may its constraining influence
 e byattend me! Prepare me for my evening work, O Lord the
     Spirit, Amen!‚Äù

     ‚ÄúI send enclosed ayletter to Martyn;yif heyis gone to sea,
 e byyou will peruse it, and send ityafter him. Theyaccount of
     Fitrut and the translation, you areyconcerned in, as much
 e byas he is, and I shall give you anyaccount of our progress
 e byfrom time toytime. We are all here very busy in one way or
     other, but with all our bustle we should not beymissed if
 e bytaken away from the face of the earth. I trust, however,
 e bysome seed is sowing, that may spring up another day.yThe
     half-caste lad,yI have had nowyayyear, during which,
     not one instance of misconduct has come to my hearing.
 e byYesterday he seriously devoted himself to the work of a
 e byMissionary,yafter ayfreeychoice, on my part, givenyhim, to
     be aywriter, or any thing else, I could serve him in. He
     has begun to-day to learn Latinyfrom Lieut. Harrington,

     European boy,yLatin. He is nowyabout eighteen; he is
 e byreading and writing Persian too,yand learning to translate
 e byinto Hindoostaneeyhis native tongue. The other native boys
 e bymake considerable proficiency.yI keep a strict hand over
     them.‚Äù

On the first day of the newyyear, Mr. Corrie again wrote to Mr.
Martyn,ybut it was chieflyyabout private matters.yThe letter,
however, to Mr. Brown, which enclosed that to Mr. M. is of more
general interest.

                                         ‚ÄúCawnpore,yJan. 1, 1811.

     ‚ÄúI send another note for Martyn. He tells me you must
 e bywaityfor pa  r from England before you can print the
     Hindoostanee.yThe late arrivals in our department are not
     favourable specimens of their labours at Cambridgeyand
 e byLeadenhall street. Theyyare frightened,yI fancy,yby the
     Twinings,[72] &c.:ybut yet what can they do if men will
     not offer themselves? During my late journeys in these
 e byparts,yI observed the idol-temples and the mosques, in
     most places falling toydecay, and with little appearance of
 e bybeing frequented. Here and there ayrich underling of some
     of the Company‚Äôs servants has retiredyand built a pagoda
 e byto commemorate his ill-gotten wealth; but in general,
     the spirit and fury of idolatry does not appear.yI have
 e bythought much,yif the time were but come for the labourers
 e byto enter in, the gospelywould not fail to be attended to.
 e byBut where are the labourers? At best, I was never but an
 e byunder-servant, and now my hands are full of Europeans:
 e byand the Company‚Äôs Chaplains will alwaysybe so, unless
     there were more of them. May weyhave more of the spirit of
 e byprayer, that the Lord may ‚Äògive the word,‚Äô and then ‚Äògreat
 e byshall be the company of the preachers!‚Äô

     ‚ÄúI have very little comfort in the work of the ministry
 e byamong the Europeans. I consider ityalwaysya secondary
 e byconsideration, yet howytoybe doing it more for the heathen,
 e byI knowynot. At Agra, I suppose there may be greater
     opportunities; but Martyn will not hold upymany months
 e byunder the duties of this station, soyI hope to beycontinued
     with him.‚Äù

The following extractyfrom his Journal informs us of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs
private occupationsyand purposes:--

     ‚ÄúJanuary 2nd,y1811. Iyam much occupied in reading Greek,
 e byand other exercises, tending,yI hope, to mutual benefit
 e bywith H., but let me not deceive myself inyfancying it all
     duty,ywhen it is all so agreeable. Theychildrenyhave made
 e byconsiderable progress during the past year: as much as I
 e bycould expect.yJames has begun Latin,yunder the express idea
     of becoming a teacher of others: and may heyhave grace to
     give himself willingly to this work! Iyam very much taken
 e byup with schemes for the furtherance of the gospel; but
     little is yet done. TheyEuropeans require more time and
 e bylabour thanyI have to give [to them.] Blessed be God for
     some successyamong them. O may theyy[who fear God] increase
 e byin number! During theyyear, my proficiency has been very
 e byscanty:ysome knowledgeyof the history of this country,ysome
     proficiency in Hindoostanee; the Hindoostaneeycatechism:
 e bythese are my chief employments, beside my ministry among
     the Europeans. I purpose to be more in the study of these
     languages, more in writing sermons, more attentive to
     the children; to translate the Pilgrim‚Äôs Progress, the
     Prayer book,yand any other work that may be useful to the
 e bychildren. Lord, direct my steps,yand make meyan instrument
     of good for Jesus‚Äô sake, Amen!‚Äù

It will be recollected that, in consequence of a sermon which Mr.
Brown preached    New-year‚Äôs day, 1810,yan important effort was made
to supply the Christians of Tanjore with Bibles. Encouraged,yit would
seem,yby the successywhich attended that effort, Mr. Martyn,ywhilst
in Calcutta was induced to occupy Mr. Brown‚Äôs pulpit on the 1st of
January, 1811, for the purpose of making ‚ÄúAn appeal    behalf of
900,000 Christians inyIndia who were in want of a Bible.‚Äù This Sermon
not onlyyproduced a lasting effect on those who heard it delivered,
but having been printedyand widely circulated, called forthyamong the
Europeans inyIndia,ya strong feeling of sympathy in behalf of the
native Christians, and contributed mainlyytowards the formation of
an Auxiliary Bible Society in Calcutta. It is toythese circumstances
that allusion is made in the following letter; although the Auxiliary
Society was not actually formed till the 21st of February.[73]


                        TO THE REV. D. BROWN.

                                        ‚ÄúCawnpore,yJan. 28,y1811.

     ‚ÄúI am much pleased with the idea of an Auxiliary Bible
     Society. I wonder the thought had not occurredybefore. When
     we receive Martyn‚Äôs sermon I hope we shall be able to get
 e byyou helpyfrom this [place].yI have mentioned the sermon
 e byin several places,     it will be read here with great
 e byeagerness. Weyhave no support from our new General: heysets
 e bybut a very indifferent example to the community,ywhilst
  e bhe is quiet and civil enough in private. ‚ÄòTo the poor the
     gospelyis preached,‚Äô and they receive it, though not in
 e bygreat numbers.

     ‚ÄúI have had five long journeysysince November, and expect
 e byto go to Bareilly next week to attend two marriages. At
     the other end of the cantonments I have lately begun to
     assemble the Light Dragoonsyon a Thursday evening. At first
  e bmany came,yand a few still continue to attend. Most of our
     Hymn-books are distributed, and numbers of the Bibles, but
     few of the New Testaments....

     ‚ÄúI am at present in very good health,yand strong toylabour.
     Weyhave service three times    Sundays,yand on Wednesday,
 e byThursday,yand Friday evenings. Theydistance between the
     two European regiments, makes double labour, but (blessed
     be God!) it is not labour in vain. And whilst there is no
     service thatycould well be dispensed with I can do nothing
     better thanypatiently ‚Äòspendyand be spent,‚Äô while strength
     remains. Even now the hospitals are sadly neglected, but
     the godly men,yand especially Harrington, supply the lack
 e bywith great diligence.‚Äù

Of the journey to Bareilly (about 170 miles distantyfrom Cawnpore)
there is a short notice in Mr. C‚Äôs Journal, dated,

     ‚ÄúFebruary 21st.yI have had a journey to Bareilly. H. went
     with me to Futtyghur.yI have reason to bless God for
     preservation from angry tempers during theyjourney, and
 e byfor the much sweet converseyI had with H. In riding along,
     ourbmanner was toyread a sentence from a book,yand to
     converseyupon it; or sing a hymn. In this way weariness
     was prevented,yand my heart often burned within me. Let me
 e byhowever watch and pray that the things which I have wrought
     be not lost.yO, may I never be suffered to faint or grow
     weary in the heavenly way! My inward frame and spirit is
 e bysadly prone to this. I have to drag this ‚Äòbody of sin‚Äô
     along with me. How often would my spirit sit down toyrest;
     or,ywearied with the constant load, yield to the death!
     Lord, preserveyand uphold me to the end! Amen.‚Äù

During theytwo months following theydate of this extract, Mr. Corrie
was chiefly occupied with the ordinary clerical duties at Cawnpore.
Besidesythese however, heydid not cease to employ himself in urging
on the translation of the Old Testament into Hindoostanee, which
Mirza Fitrut had commenced under the superintendence of Mr. Martyn;
and Mr. C‚Äôs correspondence about this time shews him, also, to have
been actively engaged in furthering theyobjects contemplatedyby the
Calcutta Bible Society,     in collecting subscriptions for it.yThus
in a letter to Mr. Brown, Mr. C.yobserves,

                                                  ‚ÄúApril 8,y1811.

     ‚ÄúI wrote to Fitrut on the receipt of your last. He sends
     word, that he is unwell,ybut will come over soon. I expect
 e byhim daily,ybut suppose he will raise obstacles. Theycopy
     of Martyn‚Äôs sermon which Mr. T. sent me,yhas not been at
 e byhome a day since it arrived. Applications from all hands
     are daily made for it.yThe people are astonished at the
     _number_ of Christians in India. Whilst they have been
     objecting toyconversion, behold a harvest is already
     gathered! I have the promise ofbmany subscriptions,
     chiefly, indeed, from thoseywho have not much to give; but
     till I can tell them all about you in Calcutta, I know not
 e byexactly onywhat ground to askyfor subscriptions.‚Äù

And, again,yin a letter to Mr. Brown, during theysame month:--

     ‚ÄúBy Fitrut‚Äôs desireyI send you the enclosed. Before it
 e byarrives, you will have determinedyon his request. He is
 e bynow ready to set off, but thatyI do not choose absolutely
     to promise the increase of salary he wishes for. In the
  e bmeantime,yhe is going on translating, and he comes every
  e bmorning for an hour or two, to superintend my translations
     also. No _banghy_yhas yet arrived with sermon &c., but Col.
     P.yhas written to Lieut.yL., assistantycommissary here,
 e byrequesting his aidyand exertions for the Bible Society. He
     sent a sermon and a copy of the proceedings, &c.[74] Mr.
     Lumsdaine,yaccordingly, is getting subscriptions from his
 e byfriends. Theygeneral has given 200 rupees,yand the plan of
     the society is generally approved. The public attention
 e byhas been greatly excited, and our friends here thought it
     advisable to give the subject all the publicity possible;
     so yesterday,yI gave notice from the pulpit, thatyo  Sunday
 e bynext, I shall preach a sermon on the subject of the Holy
     Scriptures, and state theyviews of the society lately
     formed in Calcutta, in aidyof the British and Foreign Bible
     Society in London, &c.yI had before waited on Mr. L. and
 e byagreed to act in concert.yThus,bmore advantage to the cause
 e byis likely to arise than we ever hoped for; we wantyonly
     copies of proceedings, &c., to gratify the attention thus
 e byfar excited, before it subsides.

     ‚ÄúThe religious men of the 53rd., I understand, mean to
     give each a month‚Äôs pay. They say,ythey have before been
     called upon for a month‚Äôs pay, to help toycarry on the war,
     much more will they contribute ‚Äòto the help of the Lord
 e byagainst the mighty.‚ÄôyI have great reason for thankfulness
     for the acceptance the word of God has among us. Theychurch
 e byis usually crowded in the part allottedyto the gentry,
     and our societies increase considerably. Even the wild
     Irish Roman Catholics of the 8th Light Dragoons, pay great
     attention,yand the Thursday evenings attendance increases.
     A sergeant, his wife,yand several others of them, appear in
     good earnest seeking salvation. TheyCompany‚Äôs Europeans are
     the least attentive,yand indeed, with a few exceptions, the
     Company‚Äôs officers are the least constant at church. I have
     a Hindoostanee congregation of nine,yevery morning, and am
     going through the Epistles with them. Theyhalf-caste lad
     I have mentioned, has began to read to them. He continues
     to give good hope that his heart is in the work;yand the
     children also, continue improving. I am often greatly
 e byexhausted from the frequent public services,yand feel often
     much inward weakness. Should I ever be relieved from this,
     I would try to get to sea for a few weeks, just recruit
 e bystrength,     prevent the frame from giving way entirely.
     I have many thoughts about Benares; if you send theycopies
     of proceedings to E., I fear he will never distribute
     them. You should send some to Robinson. I am desirous to
     see the proceedings of Martyn, when you can spare his
 e byletter. You cannot suppose how widowed I feel from his
 e byabsence.... Mr. Y. tells me there is a Bible Depository in
     Calcutta. Whoyhas theycharge of it? I have been applied to
     for information about it, but could give none.... To-day,
     I have a letter from Martyn dated 19th March, ‚ÄòBombay,‚Äô
     containing extracts from Simeon, on _not_ taking fees,yfar
  e bmore pointed than his cautions to P.‚Äù

But assiduously occupied as Mr. Corrie thus appears to have been in
furthering every plan that promised to yield moral benefit to his
fellow-men, he was nevertheless alive,yat theytime,yto the importance
of watching over theystate of religion in his own soul. On the
anniversary of his birth-day he writes:--

     ‚ÄúApril 10th. This day I am thirty-four. It was theynight
     I heard of my mother‚Äôs death, February 1798, thatyI first
 e byremember my resolutions made to be religious. Till the
     summer of 1801,yI went on sinning and repenting, as I
     thought; but quite ignorant of the authoryand finisher of
     salvation. In the latter end of that year,bmyyviews of
     scripture truth became more distinct; and, since then,
     I have gone on my way, ‚Äòlooking unto Jesus;‚Äôybut every
     year has brought me,yit should seem, only experience
     of my own depravity. True,yI have experience of ‚Äòthe
     Lord‚Äôs mercy,‚Äô too, in that I am ‚Äònot consumed;‚Äôyand the
     fulness, freeness, and efficacy of they‚Äòfountain opened‚Äô
     to purify my guilty soul is so fully known to my soul,
     and my own hope in that ‚Äòblood shed for the remission
 e byof sins,‚Äô so stayed, thatymy own guilt does not dismay
 e byme,yas it otherwise might well do:yat theysame time,yone
     propensity after another to evil starts up so unavoidably,
     that doubtless,bmyysoul is ‚Äòfull of wounds, and bruises,
     and putrifying sores:‚Äô to Thee,ytherefore, O divine
     Physician, doyI turn my fainting eyes. I come to Thee for
     healing, that it would please Thee toycast theysalt of
 e byThy grace into this impure fountain, that theystreams may
 e bybe purified from the noxious qualities, which now render
  e bunfruitful the whole field of the soul. O Lord, I pray
 e bythat theyoverflowings of sin may be restrained; teach me
     to watch     pray; quicken me to diligence in this work,
     and service; enable me to ‚Äògive attendance to reading, to
 e byexhortation,yto doctrine;‚Äôyto ‚Äògive myself wholly to them,
     that my profiting may appear‚Äôyin the edification of thy
 e bypeople, through the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!‚Äù

     ‚ÄúJune 10th. This day nine years ago, I was ordained a
 e bydeacon;yand on the twelfth of June, two years after, a
 e bypriest. I have sinned grievously in respect of personal
     holiness; and, during the last year,balso, I fear, as
     much asyever. I know not what to doyagainstymy strong
     foe, ‚Äòwhose name is legion.‚ÄôyThe Lord knows I purpose
 e byperpetual enmity with every sin;yand,yI think,yif it were
     the will of God to take away every disposition to evil,
     I should rejoice; but, at theysame time,yshould require
     such measures of grace to keep me humble, as seem out of
     the way of God‚Äôs usual method to bestow. Indeed, when I
     feel such a disposition to self-importance in a very short
     time,yif my evil dispositions are quiet, what devilish
 e byprideyshould I not be puffed up with,yif my heart were
     freed from corruption. Blessed be God, I can say, that no
     sin hath dominion over me; yet doyI not justify myself:
     though I am often surprised, a   get a spiritual fall, yet
     the enemy cannot keep me down: by faith I rise, by faith I
 e bystand; a   ‚Äòin the Lord have I righteousness and strength.‚Äô
     I have been at Cawnpore about a year; and since October
     have had the whole charge: ten are added to the (religious)
     society since then; and several are enquiring after the
     ways of godliness. Some of the light dragoons, (especially
     sergeant R.) are, I hope,yseriously impressed. Gracious
     God, I praise Thee for these fruits! I have to mourn my
  e bunprofitableness among theybetter sort.yI think I am not
     suited to doygood by much visiting, and, therefore, stay
     at home. I have been employed a great deal in translating
     for theychildren; and Nicholas is very hopeful: these in
 e byall a   six, besides those whoycame yesterday. God ofyall
     grace, theyFather of our Lord Jesus Christ, give me a
 e bylarger portion of the Holy Spirit‚Äôs grace: make me holy
     in body, soul, and spirit; ‚Äòholiness becometh thy house.‚Äô
     O Lord, my soul is athirst for holiness. Teach me how to
 e bypreach holiness through the Spirit, and by the Saviour!
     But, I am forbidden by the doctors to preach, on account
     of this liver. May I pray the more for the souls around
 e byme: O forya spirit of grace and supplication! To Thee,yO
     Lord, have I dedicated myself;yat thy table, yesterday,
 e bydid I give myself away to Thee; and, though the watchful
     enemy robbed me of part of theybenefit, yet, I know, thou
     hast accepted me: Thouydidst sit at thine own table;yit
     was a season of refreshment to many, as well as to myself;
     about fifty attended; in the evening, a large congregation.
     I hope soon to establish worship for the Hindoostanees;
     James,yI trust, is fully bent on this work, though he has a
 e bygood deal of youthful levity about him. Lord, bless all my
 e byflock,ymy dear family, and friends! Bless myysoul, O Lord,
     and let myysoul praise Thee at all times!‚Äù

Theyfollowing letter to Mr. Simeon, whilst giving a general outline
of the religious condition of Cawnpore, asypresented during Mr.
Corrie‚Äôs ministrations at that station,yexplains also, the lofty,
self-denying principle on which both Mr. Martyn and himself had
decided to waive theyaccepting ofyany fee for the celebration of
marriages, &c.

                                         ‚ÄúCawnpore, June 4, 1811.

     ‚ÄúAs your Indian friends are, at this time,ywidely
     separated, I shall not be likely to trouble youywith
  e brepetition of intelligence from this quarter, and I know
 e byyouywill take part in the hopes and fears attending the
     work of the ministry in this place. Youywill, I hope,yhear
     from Mr. Martyn himself from Persia; the last I heard of
     him was from Bombay, March 19th. He had benefited little,
     or nothing, from the change. Since his departure, I have
 e byhad much encouragement in my work. I began with a very
 e bydiscouraging impression of mybunfitness toystand up in
 e byhis place, but the word delivered in weakness, has been
     attended with power to several. Ten have been added to the
  e breligious society, and several are onyprobation,yin one
 e byof the European Regiments; in the other, someygood has
     been done, a   even from among theyCompany‚Äôs Artillery-men
 e by(surely the most hardened againstyall good, ofyany set of
     men I ever saw) five are become regular attendants at the
     Lord‚Äôs Table. We might have hoped for more abundant fruit;
     but that it was the Divineywill Iyshould be laid up a third
 e bytime with the liver, and obliged to desist from all labour
     but the Sunday‚Äôs duty. I am now so affected with mercury,
 e bythat I cannot appear next Sunday, but I am happy toysay,
 e bythat for several days the pains have left me, and I trust
     the disease has subsided. I hope the life, thusbrepeatedly
     renewed to me,ywill be more than ever devoted to the work
 e byof the ministry, for truly I find no life like living to
 e byChrist. His service isyperfect freedom and a great reward!

     ‚ÄúMy absence from the Irish regiment has been most felt;
     as in the English regiment, one of the officers, a nephew
 e byof the late Dr. Elliston of SidneyyCollege,yhas supplied
 e bymyylack of service, by reading &c., having ‚Äòfirst given
     himself unto the Lord.‚Äô We have every Wednesday evening
     a party ofyfriends, whoytake sweet counsel together. It
     consists, when altogether, ofya Lieutenant of Dragoons
     and hisywife, theyPaymaster of they53rd and hisywife, an
 e byAssistant Surgeon, theyabove Lieutenant, my sister, and
     a youngylady who is living with her; we sometimes have
 e bybeside, another Surgeon and hisylady, whoyhave been brought
 e byup among religious people; an officer on the staff here,
     and, now and then,ya friend from the country; and there are
     others, whoyapprove and are hopeful, though they do not yet
     care to come out from the world. When we thus happily meet,
     we are encouraged to think, the whole world must speedily
     bow before the word of theyLord; but, alas, we return again
     with the complaint of Melancthon. The multitude, alas,
 e bytread heedlessly the broad way!

     ‚ÄúYouywill know of theyformation of an Auxiliary Bible
     society in Calcutta. It has raised ‚Äònoysmall stir about
 e bythat way.‚Äô Here we have had good success,ybut the enemy
     also has been at work. My application to the Commander
     of one of the corps here, was yesterday returned, with
  e bmany concessions as to the purity of our motives, but
  e brepresenting this new association as the most dangerous
 e bything imaginable, and praying me, a   others, to desist
     from promoting the objects of it. In two entire regiments,
     out of theyfive,ywe have been thus hindered, but blessed
 e bybe God, we have abmajority, even inypoint of numbers. One
 e byundeniable benefit has arisen from it, even to the English;
     for after a sermon Iypreached on the subject, April 28th,
     we had a greater number ofyapplications for English Bibles,
 e bythan for many months together before.

     ‚ÄúDuring this month my school ofyChristian boys has
     increased to nine. I hear them myself twice a day, and
     find they learn even quicker than many English boys. Some
 e byof the parents, seeing how desirous I am to retain these
     children at school, plague me not a little for moneyyto
 e bysupport themselves also,ysaying they must otherwise remove
 e byto someyother place, and take their children with them. The
 e byChristian man I left atyChunar, has within these few days
     arrived here, having left his charge. The house I fitted
 e byup, isystill used for public worship by the Europeans, but
  e bno one pities my poor black flock, so they are again left
     in the wideywilderness. A few of them, whoyhave, I trust
     been madeypartakersyof the Holy Ghost, and have tasted
 e byof the good word of God, attend the service in English,
 e bythough they understand nothing of what is said, yet they
     hear the name of ‚Äò_Jesu Kreesht_,‚Äô and, that, they say,
 e by‚Äòisypleasure.‚Äô At thisyplace there are many Christians of
     Portuguese descent, but, in language a   manners, quite
 e byHindoostanees. Through two ofymyyChristian people, who,
     I trust, are real Christians, a desire has been excited
     among them for hearing and reading the Scriptures. The
     youth I have mentioned, of European descent, is with me
 e bystill, and very promising. I hope to establish worship in
     Hindoostanee, in a month‚Äôs time, for theyabove native
     christians here, and tobmake thisylad officiate. If I were
     able to officiate myself, I would not set him so forward
     yet, but our friends here advise that, considering the
     difficulty ofyagain putting affairs in the train they now
 e byare, we had better secure the present opportunity, and
     hope and pray that the Lord will be with us, till Martyn‚Äôs
  e breturn, when heywill find the way he had prepared, somewhat
     carried forward, a   may enlarge it after, as he judges
     proper. He had addressed himself to the multitude at large
     who used toyassemble every Sunday evening, on hisylawn,
 e bytill hisyhealth and strength were exhausted. My health and
 e bystrength have been brought nearly as low, though I have a
 e bystronger constitution to renewyupon; so I set theyabove
     servants to work at the houses of individual Christians,
     and now hope to establish aysmall congregation from among
 e bythem, against our brother‚Äôs return.

     ‚ÄúFrom Bombay, M. sent me aypart of a letter of your‚Äôs, on
 e bythe subject of fees, which he desired me to consider. I
 e bybeg leave to state a few particularsyonythat subject for
     your information. First, all in the army, below the rank of
     Captain, are obliged to use the strictest economy, in order
     tobmaintain a family. A Captain may live without care,
     but, if it be considered that he must send his children to
 e byEngland for education, it will be easily believed, that
     every married military man, who has a family, isylikely to
 e bybe poor to the e   of his service, with the exception of a
     few, whoyget staff-appointments, and they are almost the
 e byonly ones whoyare ever able to return home. When we are
     sent for toya distance, the expences of travelling are paid
 e byby the parties, which usually costs from fortyyto sixty
     pounds. It isyusually the younger officers whoymarry, for
 e bythe old ones almost all live in sin: and indeed from the
 e byabove circumstances, together with the few opportunities of
  e breligious instruction, most of theyyoung ones too; and some
 e byhave told me plainly, that they could get nobodyyto marry
 e bythem, and if they could, they had not moneyyto give, as
     wasyusually expected by the Chaplains. For these causes,
     from the first, I wished to decline being an obstacle in
 e bythe way ofyany. Sometimesyyoung men marry the daughtersyof
 e byold Indians by native mothers, but though the father could
 e byoften give a fee in this case, he has himself sacrificed
     conscience to money, and thinks any one would do the same,
     and how are we to convince him to the contrary, but by
     refusing his money? The civilians whoymarry, are also
 e byusually of theyyounger part, and have nothing to spare
     without borrowing, which they can do indeed too easily.
 e byThe elder civilians are altogether asypreposterously paid
 e byto excess, and indeed there are very few of them, whoyare
     not in consequence, so vain, and carry themselves soyhigh,
 e bythat I know not how we can shew them the folly of trusting
 e byin these things, but by refusing the opportunities of
  e bobtaining them. On this head, there will he difference of
 e byopinion, but my humble judgment is, to renounce the fee,
 e byto convince them by all possible means, that a man‚Äôs life
     consisteth not in these things. In so doing, we are not
     injuring our successor, because he has a sufficiency of
 e byincome for all the purposes that his station in life can
  e brequire. I suppose you do not care whether we be able to
 e bykeep a carriage, or not, if we should ever return; and
 e bysuppose we save but enough toypay our passage toyEngland,
 e bythe retiring pension is an abundant provision for our
     necessities. I suppose, that even a chaplain marries, and
     has children, then even he has plenty to educateythem,
 e bythough hisyusefulness here may be thereby confined, a  
 e byin what situation would it not be so? I see no motive for
     receiving fees that ought to be entertained a moment, but
 e bythat of taking them to give to the poor, and such has been
 e bythe state of things among the British here hitherto, that
     the mention of such a motive would have excited derision,
     as mere hypocrisy. It has never been conceived, that a man
     came to India, except tobmake money. After all, dear Sir,
 e bywe have no such thing as a regular fee; we are military
     chaplains, and the general could order us to officiate, in
 e byany part of the district, there being no legal impediment:
 e by_you_ can recover theyaccustomed offering by law; _we_ have
     no law onythe subject, nor do the soldiers ever,yonyany
     occasion, offer a fee. We have indeed custom on our side,
     but it is a custom that has made the name of Chaplain an
  e boffence. Would government but appoint a regular supply of
 e byChaplains, and let any reasonable fee be appointed, for
     occasional duties, as a part of their subsistence, it would
 e bybe well. O, I wish that some of theyyoung men around you,
 e bydid but see the different stations of India, where numbers
     of their countrymen areyactually falling into the jaws of
  e binfidelity and deism, for the want of some one merely to
 e byremind them of theycustoms and opinions of their native
     land. They come out boys; they leave the Sabbath and public
     worship behind them; they straightway fall into sinful
 e byhabits, and grow toyargue for that, which they would once
 e byhave blushed to mention. But what, if theyyoung clergy
     knew, and pitied, and were willing to come over and help
 e byus, what could they do whilst the way is shut againstythem?
 e byConsider,ythis district contains, I know not the exact
     number, but I know twelve subordinate stations, at each
     of which, there will be from twenty to fortyyEnglish and
 e bynative Christians inythe Company‚Äôs service; at Allahabad,
 e byone hundred miles to the east, there are about twoyhundred
  e bEuropeans alone; at Futtyghur eighty miles to the west,
 e bythere are at least as many, and at Bareilly not much less
 e bythan a hundred. To these places, the Chaplain of Cawnpore
     must go, to celebrateymarriages, for this is the only
     duty he cannot be dispensed with for; but as toyall other
     religious services, they are left entirely destitute, and
 e byfrom the long habits of indifference they have been in, it
     is not always, even when we do go, that we can have public
     worship. O, dear Sir, ought the immense revenues of this
 e byfruitful land to be wholly appropriated to the purposes of
  e bmerchandize! Ought the souls of our own countrymen, not to
 e byspeak of theynatives, to be weighed inythe balance against
     bales of silk and cotton! Surely this system will have an
  e bend!

 e byObservers, with the paper war with the Christian

     you cannot confer a greater favour,ythan by forwarding to
 e bythis country, supplies of Christian Guardians, Eclectic
     Reviews, Christian Observers, &c. We can lend them about,

     about religious books.

     inythe inner man. The Lord can send by whom he will, but
 e bymy soul would mourn toyhear, that that candlestick, which
 e bywas the means of guiding me into divine light and peace,

     Sir, be more blessed than the former, and when heart and

The illness which Mr. Corrie mentions inythe foregoing letter, as
havingy‚Äòobliged him to desist from all labour, except the Sunday
duty,‚Äô now continued toyincrease upon him; so that, inythe beginning
of July he was not only laid aside from duty, but confined to the
house. From his Journal it appears, also, that he suffered greatly
from the exhaustion consequent on fever; and that he was much
harassed by impatience and a nervous irritability of temper.yAdded to
this, Mr. C., states himself to have been distressed by the ‚Äòmournful
view,‚Äô which his mind took ‚Äòofythe desolate state of professing
Christians inyIndia, scattered as sheep upon the hills.‚Äô With the
hope, therefore, of recruiting both health andyspirits, he spent a
fortnight or more on the river. His correspondence at the same time,
shews that the pressure of bodily sickness did not prevent Mr. C.,
from occupying his mind with plans for the per   ent welfare of India.

 e byGranges;[76] but after some days, through divine mercy, it
     left me, exceedingly weakened, so that although now, inymy
     own opinion, able to officiate inypublic,ythose about me
 e bywill not let me.

 e by‚ÄúI had a letter from Martyn, dated 24th.yApril, at Muscat.
 e byHe gets no stronger, I fear; but you will have heard from
     him yourself: I begin greatly toywish him back again. Since
  e bI have been confined to the house, Mr. Sherwood and Mr.

 e by‚ÄúMy Moonshee, as you will expect, is onythe way to
     Serampore, he left this [place] near a fortnight ago.
 e byFitrut alarmed him greatly at last, by telling him that
     he knows Sabat is his great enemy, and that nothing but
     disgrace and loss of character will ensue to him. Fitrut
     is himself gone to Lucknow, he is at work onythe Psalms,
 e byhavingypassed by Esther and Job; he has given in as far as
 e bythe 37th.yThe translation is, inygeneral, very excellent.
 e byI hope that the Psalms, when properly corrected,ywill be
     printed separately; no good will be done to any extent,
 e bytill the Scriptures are printed; therefore, God be thanked
 e byfor the Calcutta Auxiliary Bible Society! Y. toldbme of the
     opposition to the measure at Madras.y‚ÄòIt must needs be that
     offences come, but woe to that man by whom they come.‚Äô I

 e byat home to this society: but it is founded onya rock.

 e by‚ÄúI have been thinkingymuch about a representation being
 e bymade to somebody or other at home, (perhaps the Archbishop
     of Canterbury), onythe subject of the want of Chaplains
     in India. As everything is inya state of tranquillity
     here, and the revenues [are] flourishing, perhaps it
     might be attended to. At Allahabad there ought to be a
     Chaplain, and at Futtyghur, and at Rewaree and Kurnaul.
 e byAt Allahabad there are always two companies of Artillery,
 e byand a large society besides; and at Rewaree, and Kurnaul
     about the same. At Futtyghur, one company, and a large
 e bysociety of Commissioners, Civilians, &c. And at Benares,
 e bythere is certainly need of a chaplain; there should also,
 e byat Cawnpore and Chunar, be one King‚Äôs chaplain, at least
     at each station, or an additional Company‚Äôs chaplain. I
     am toldbhow little likely such a representation would be
 e byto produce the desired effect, but there is no saying. If
     you, the senior, were to draw up andysign something ofythis
 e bykind, andysend it to the juniors for their signatures,
     it appears to me, it would certainly be attended to,
 e byespecially ifythe King should recover, and the present
     ministers remain inyoffice.

     to be able to write to you as I couldbwish, so delayed
 e bysending off this. I ought not however to detain the
 e bySociety‚Äôs money. I fear a voyage to sea will be necessary
 e byto get me quite well. I was reduced so much that the
     doctors made me leave off mercury; but they talk of making
 e byme begin again to use it, three times a day. They say,
 e bythere is little or no danger inythe complaint; it may be
 e byso, but I would have myy‚Äòloins girded about‚Äô and myy‚Äòlamp
     burning.‚Äô Iylament the falling off of the people at church,
 e bywhilst I rejoice I am much comforted by the faith and love
     of the helpers supplied to me.‚Äù

But notwithstanding the means used by Mr. Corrie for the recovery
of his health, it pleased God still to afflict him. The medical men
accordingly continuedyto prohibit his performance of any public duty
for at least six weeks or more. During this cessation from duty, he
took advantage of a summons to marry a couple at Coel, to perform
the greaterypart of the journey to that place by boat on the river,
and purposed to spend a short time at Coel for the benefit of change
of air. Many days, however,yhad not passed over before Mr. C. took
cold, and his ‚Äòframe began toysink and his spirits to languish.‚Äô
He therefore decided onyreturning to Cawnpore, and proposed taking
Agra inyhis way, havingybeen engaged to solemnize aymarriage there.
But before he reachedyAgra, the fever returned uponyhimywith great
violence, so that he was detained onythe road and reduced to a state
of extreme debility. Some account of this journey is given in a
letter.

 e by‚ÄúI made a journey by water to this neighbourhood, and then
     by _dawk_ to this place. We convened the settlementyfor
     public worship onySunday, and had evening service with the
     family. They are very kind to me, and I hope I help to
     remove the prejudices of some againstythe cause we wish to
 e byserve, by bringingybefore them sometimes the other side of
     the question about missions. The commanding officer here is
 e byan intelligent man; he favours the Bible Society, as you
 e bywill know. I have lent himya copy of Martyn‚Äôs Hindoostanee
     New Testament: he says that he will have it copied andysent
 e byto the Portuguese, drummers, &c. He is somewhat acquainted
 e bywith Persian andyArabic, and expresses himself gratified by
     what he has seen of the translation.

 e by‚ÄúI ought to have written to Moonshee before this, but for
     a month I have not been near a post-office, except just in
     passing Futtyghur. I am greatly benefited by change of air,
 e byand hope my little flock are suffering no lack, through the
 e bykindness of Harrington and Sherwood. But I fear staying
 e byaway longer than needful, and am now anxious to be at
     Cawnpore.

 e by‚ÄúAgra, Saturday, 31st. I have had a severe attack of
     illness,ywhich laid me up onythe road to this [place]. A
 e bywhole day I was in a wretchedyBazaar, and learned something
     of the value of home and friends to a sick man. But my mind
 e bywas undisturbed.

 e by  e by‚ÄúLord, I believe thou hast prepared,
 e by  e by Unworthy though I be,
 e by  e by For me a blood-bought, free, reward
 e by  e by A goldenyharp for me.‚Äù

 e by‚ÄúI am confined to Colonel Bowie‚Äôs quarters, and was only
     just able last night to marry the young people. I am sorry
 e byto find the Bible Society has been so little encouraged
 e byhere; but I cannot go out to see people on the subject. The
 e bysurgeonyhere tells me, I must go to sea.‚Äù

Yet afterya few days repose, added to God‚Äôs blessing on the kind
attentions of his host atyAgra, Mr. Corrie was sufficiently recovered
to allow of his proceeding on his journey, and before his arrival at
Cawnpore he found himself much recruited inystrength.yAs, however,
he seems now to have been convinced, that his illness was chiefly to
be attributed to the frequency of his preaching; Mr. C. considered
it to be his duty to resolve to be more careful inythat respect for
the future. Still,ywith reference to that matter he remarks inyhis
Journal:--

 e by‚ÄúI trust it is with a single eye to future usefulness that
 e byI purpose to be more careful of my health, and to be less
 e byengaged in preaching.‚Äù

But when he was again settled among his flock at Cawnpore, Mr. C‚Äôs
purpose to be ‚Äúless engaged in preaching,‚Äù was but partially carried
into effect. He writes, for example, under date of

 e by‚Äú18th.ySept. [1811.] I have been thinking of three
 e byseparate courses of sermons. First, forySunday mornings:
 e byto begin with man‚Äôs ruin; justification; illumination;
 e byseparation from the world; progress inythe ‚Äòfruits of the
 e bySpirit.‚Äô Secondly, for the Wednesday evenings: a view of
     the church of Christ; its establishment; progress; and
     final triumph inythe world, notwithstanding the opposition
     of Satan:ya course from Matt. xvi. 18., onythe plan of
     Edward‚Äôs History of Redemption. Thirdly: to translate into
 e byHindoostanee, to be read by Jamesyto the Hindoostanees, a
     Commentary on Genesis i: onythe original state of man; the
     fall; the promise in succession, onyto the history of our
     Lord inythe gospels.‚Äù

 e by‚ÄúI could put twenty copies of the New Testament into
 e byimmediate use, and we go on very lamely without them.
 e byWriting is slow, incorrect, and expensive. Nothing will be
     done to purpose, till we get printed copies in abundance.
     Three of the pious soldiers are learning Hindoostanee,
     thatythey may, as they say, be able to exhort the heathen.
 e byOne of them is a superior young man, and very humble and
 e byunobtrusive. He has long wished to be able to talkywith the
 e byBrahmins atya certain pagoda, near the river, where he goes
 e byoften; and purposes reading the New Testament to them, when
 e byhe can get one.[77]

 e by‚ÄúThe Lord adds to us one by one, according to his promise.
 e bySince my return, three have joined the society, and all
 e bywalk orderly. OuryHindoostanee worship was well attended
 e bylast Sunday. Moonshee Fitrut is come back from Lucknow; he
 e byyesterday gave me the 21st. chapteryof Proverbs, the Old
 e byTestament is completed so far. I have given him a place of
     abode on the premises,yand done every thing to induce him
 e byto go on quietly. This workywill, I hope, be done inythree
 e byor four months;yand, please God to spare Martynyto put the
     finishing hand to it, will be the greatest work, as to
 e byutility, ever accomplished onythis side of India.

 e by‚ÄúBeside my other employments, I have now to translate
     from Henry‚Äôs Commentary on Genesis,ywhich serves as a
 e byHindoostanee sermon onySundays. I know nothing else you
 e bywill desire to hear of, from this [place.] The miserable
 e bysquabbles which disgust the world atythis place, I am happy
 e byto know little about. Happy privilege to be ‚Äòredeemed from
     a vain conversation,‚Äô--to be delivered ‚Äòfrom the present
 e byevil world!‚Äô O, for more power to proclaim aloud the year
     of release! My strength increases, but notya third inythe
 e byway of public duty is done, that might be done.yI preach
 e bytwice onySundays, and on Wednesday evening; and meet the
 e bysociety on Fridays. I hope to begin my weekly meeting with
 e bythe Dragoons on Thursday next: but I believe it would
 e bybe right for me to leave off, inythat case, my present
 e byWednesday evening engagement. But the three hospitals are
 e bysadly neglected;yI can on   visit those who are very ill.
 e byI dare not preach inythe wards: my breast and side are on
     fire this morning, from last night‚Äôs exertion. Yet, the
 e bycold season being set in, increases my strength, and I have
 e byno expectation but of doing well enough, until the heat
 e bycommences again.

 e by‚ÄúWe have had lately a remarkable instance of the freeness
 e byand fulness of redeeming love, inythe case of a soldier‚Äôs
 e bywife, who died here. I am collecting a few particulars
 e bywhich I may send you.‚Äù

The ‚Äúparticulars‚Äù here referred to, do notyoccuryin Mr. C‚Äôs
correspondence or Journal; but a notice of an interview he had with a
dying soldier a short time before the preceding letter was written,
may not be omitted:--

 e by‚ÄúYesterday evening I went to the hospital,yto visit J. He
 e byhas been ill some time. He considers himself in a decline,
 e byand indeed, seems to be so; he began by saying, thaty‚Äòhe
     felt very composed in his mind, looked upon the world as
     done with, and no longer any thing to him, and would be
 e byhappy, if it were the Lord‚Äôs will to take him to Himself.‚Äô
 e byI asked him when he supposed the Lord began to make him
 e bya partakeryof His grace? He said, ‚Äòit was atyChunar he
     first began to consider, and there he became somewhat
 e byenlightened, but lately his mind had become more confirmed
 e byand strengthened.‚Äô Notywishing him to be deceived, I
     reminded him of some improprieties since he leftyChunar:
 e byhe acknowledged ‚Äòthatyhe had been often led astray, and
 e byfound his heart often going wrong; but for these things
 e byhe was heartily sorry, and hoped by the grace of God to
 e byprevail against them: indeed, for some months past, he had
 e bybeen more alive to religion than ever.‚Äô I asked him the
 e byground of a sinner‚Äôs hope towards God: he replied with some
 e bycheerfulness, ‚Äòon   the Lord Jesus Christ.‚Äô I asked whatyhe
 e byexpected Christ would do for him: he said, ‚Äòto save him,
 e byand make him a partakeryof salvation with the saints in
 e byglory.‚Äô I pointed out the meaning of the word ‚Äòsaint,‚Äô and
 e byasked him ‚Äòifyhe considered thatyChrist, if he saved us,
 e bywould make us holy, and thatyheaven was the enjoyment of
     a holy God, and therefore, a happy place.‚Äô He said ‚Äòthat
 e byeven now he was happy on   when sinywas subdued within
     him; and to be freed from sinyin heaven, would be complete
 e byhappiness.‚Äô‚Äù

Amid labours such as these, Mr. Corrie writes:

 e by  e by  e by  e by  e by  e by  e b‚ÄúCawnpore, Oct. 30, 1811.

 e by‚ÄúI am recovering from an illness, thatyhas nearly laid
     me aside, ever since the 24th of April last. The Lord my
 e byhealer, I hope I may say, renews my spiritual strength, as
 e bythe outer man is brought low. It was brought on by undue
 e byprevious exertion. I trust I am taught that this is not the
 e byLord‚Äôs will. Without a miracle, we cannotyhope ouryflocks
 e bywill be fed with the bread of life after ourydecease; to
 e byabide with them is, therefore, most desirable, and to use
 e bythe means for preserving health to minister among them,
 e bynecessary.

 e by‚ÄúYou will have heard of the establishment of an Auxiliary
 e byBible Society in Calcutta. Doubtless the night has passed
     away, and the true light is now arising upon India. Mr.
 e byMartyn is gone for change of air, hoping to recover
 e byhealth, and, perhaps, avoid the threatened beginning of
 e bya consumption:yhe was at Shiraz, inyPersia, onythe 26th
 e byof June; and is atywork onyayPersian translationyof the
 e byNew Testament. His translationyof the New Testament into
 e byHindoostanee, is just put to the press; we greatly long for
 e bythis work to appear. You know,yhe was assisted by a learned
 e bynative,[78] who passed six years inyEngland, and is well
 e byacquainted with the English language also. The translation
 e byof the Baptist missionaries into Hindoostanee, is really
 e bytoo defective to be useful to any extent. You will not
 e byaccuse me of depreciating their labours:y‚ÄòI speak the truth
 e byin Christ.‚Äô I have the greater part of their work. The
 e byChristians about me lay it aside, and prefer the parts of
     scripture they have ofyMartyn‚Äôs translation.

 e by‚ÄúThe above [mentioned] learned native is living on our
 e bypremises, and goes on translating the Old Testament; in any
 e bydifficult passage he consults me about the meaning. He has
 e bytranslated to Isaiah, and is now engaged onythat book. This
 e bywork, please God to spareyMartyn to come back to correct
 e byit by the Hebrew, will be ayglorious work for Hindoostan
 e byProper. This part of India is still without a translation,
 e byexcept that of the Baptist missionaries. Two of these
     missionaries have gone to Agra:yI was there lately and saw
 e bythem; they had not then got quite settled. The natives
 e byof that quarter are very independent and fierce inytheir
 e bymanners, the Mahomedans especially. You have heard of the
 e bypopulationyof India, but can have no ideayof its immensity
 e byunless you saw it; so thatya man may visit I cannotytell
 e byhow many villages of three hundred,yfour hundred people and
 e byupwards, in a circle of six or eight miles: there seems,
 e bytherefore, little needyof itinerating according to your
 e byideayof the word; but you may think to how little an extent
 e byall that the whole of the missionaries now in India can do
 e byis likely to be felt. Yet the day, I am certain, has dawned
 e bythatywill never set till all India shall see the glory of
     the Lord.

 e by‚ÄúOf my ownyproceedings, I have little to say; my native
     school consists of ten;yfour of whom can say the whole of
 e byWatts‚Äôs scripture catechism (but indeed one of the four
 e byhas just left me to go to his friends who live far away).
 e byI read the scriptures and prayers inyHindoostanee with
 e bythem inythe school-house every morning, and amyhelped
     greatly inythese exercises, by the youth I have mentioned,
 e byof European descent. Since September, we have hadyworship
 e byin Hindoostanee;yin church onyaySunday afternoon, fifty
 e byor sixty native Christians sometimes attend, and usually
 e bythirty or forty; my ownypeople have learned to sing
 e bytranslations of psalms and hymns to English tunes: they are
 e byvery fond of them, though I know the poetry is very poor:yI
 e byhope an IndianyWatts may be raised up ere long, to regulate
 e bythe psalmody of the Indianychurch.

 e by‚ÄúYou would wish to know whatysuccess I perceive in the
 e bymidst of ourylabours. Of the Europeans, about fifteen or
 e bysixteen have been added to ourysociety during the last
 e byyear: of the natives, I cannotyspeak so certainly. One
     servant of our own has been piously inclined sometime,
 e byand I hope he is now a decided character; and one, whom
 e byyou would call a footman, who used to have all the vanity
 e byand foppery of that class at home, is become attentive,
 e bynot only to his employment, but serious inyworship, and
 e bydiligent in reading at leisure hours. I have a particular
 e byregard for this youth, and shall greatly rejoice inyhis
 e byturning to God:yhe is married, has good natural talents,
 e byis of a pleasing appearance; and though one is often
 e byshort-sighted and deceived, I fancyyhe would make aygood
 e bymissionary, ifyhe had a heart to it, which I often pray may
 e bybe granted him.

 e by‚ÄúI must not forget toytell you how happy I am at my beloved
 e bysister‚Äôs having commenced a school for native christian
     girls. She has so far mastered the language as to be able
 e byto read Hindoostanee easily, and toyunderstand it pretty
 e bywell. The little girls work as little girls do at home, and
 e bysay a lesson, and learn the Assembly‚Äôs shorter Catechism,
 e bywhich I translated long ago, and by frequent corrections
 e byhave got nearly worthy of printing. These things were
 e byhardly ever thought of for women inythis country: now and
 e bythen among the Mahomedans, aywoman is found who can read,
 e bybut I have not heard that this is ever the case among the
 e byHindoos.

 e by‚ÄúAt leisure hours, I am abridging Milner‚Äôs Church History,
 e byand have finished the first two centuries, and even
 e bytranslated about half the first:ythe scholars I have hadyso
 e bylong are growing great lads, and want something now beyond
     mere school-books: one is aypromising boy, and the others
 e byare as children at thatyage usually are.‚Äù

The expectationywhich this letter shews Mr. Corrie to have
entertained of his recovery from the illness, under which he hadybeen
suffering during the preceding six months, turned out not to be well
founded. Although he hadylatterly been somewhat more attentive to
his health,yyet the diseaseyof the liver now returned uponyhim with
increased severity, and altogether laid him aside from public duty.
Yet in a letter to Mr. Simeon, dated early in November, 1811, Mr. C.
writes:--

 e by‚ÄúOne expressionyin it [a letter from Mr. S.] has brought
 e bybefore me an entirely new train of ideas respecting my duty
 e byin the ministry. You express thankfulness, that you are
 e byenabled to do the little you do now, compared with former
 e byexertions. I perceive it is an inexpressible favour to be
 e byemployed in the Lord‚Äôs service atyall; and instead of being
 e byuneasy atynot being able to do more, I ought to be thankful
 e byfor some health,yand inclinationyto do something; and when
 e byhealth is withdrawn, it is as much a duty to _suffer_, as
 e byin health to do, the Lord‚Äôs will. Alas! I seem to arrive so
 e byslowly atyproper views ofydivine things, that opportunity
 e byis gone before properlyyunderstood.‚Äù

With reference to a friend, who after having decided on going to
India as a chaplain, changed his mind, as the time for his leaving
England approached, Mr. Corrie adds:--

 e by‚ÄúMr. L‚Äôs family I know, and regret that he has withdrawn
 e byhis hand from the plough. It is true, that the pain of
     separationyfrom relatives, and dear, dear Britain, can
 e bybe known only to those who have endured it; but truly an
 e byhundred-fold recompense attends it. No one can understand
 e bythe pangs I endured, at times, between the time when first,
 e byin youryrooms, the idea of carrying the gospel to heathen
 e bylands took possessionyof my mind, and the periodyof my
 e byleaving England. Yet dear as all the places, persons, and
 e byprivileges enjoyed at home still are, I would notyreturn to
 e bythem on any considerationyI am at present acquainted with.
 e byHere the light of the glow-worm even is splendid, so gross
 e byisythe surrounding darkness; and every stone put into moral
     order is so much rescued from chaos.‚Äù

The following extract from Mr. C.‚Äôs Journal will explain the nature
of the communings which he held, at this time, with his own heart:--

 e by‚ÄúSunday, Nov. 17th. I am prevented this day from
 e by[attending] public worship. O, that I were more alive to
 e bythe importance of the ministry, and more fitted for the
 e bysacred duties of it. I do not lament, as I ought, the
 e byinterruptionyof any duty, nor am humbled, as I ought to be,
 e byunder the mighty hand of God. I think that the world and
 e bythe fear of manyhave less hold, [of me]ybut am afraid it
 e byis more from a spirit of misanthropy than faith. I see the
 e byfolly of natural men: I feel the best of creatures [to be]
     miserable comforters; I fear I despise them, rather than
 e bylook above them to God. How deeply do I perceive and feel,
 e bythat nothing but the power of God can make me ‚Äòa right
 e byspirit,‚Äô or ‚Äòcreate inyme a clean heart.‚Äô May the Almighty
 e byGod, the Lord, whoseyoffice it is to quicken the souls of
     men, renew my whole body, soul and spirit, and command a
 e byblessing uponythose around me, who all need his influence
 e byas much as I do myself; some to be converted, some to be
 e byguided in the narrow way; one and all to be fitted for
 e byheaven!‚Äù

The continued absenceyof Mr. Martynyfrom India, induced the
government to appointyanother chaplain to Cawnpore, without, however,
superseding Mr. M. This, therefore, left Mr. Corrie at liberty to
proceed to Calcutta, for the purpose of recruiting his health. As,
however, it was not unlikely that the new chaplain might think it his
duty to confine his ministrations exclusively to the Europeans at
Cawnpore, it became desirable toyprovide for the carrying on of those
missionary operations for the instruction of the native christians
and others, which hadybeen originatedyby Mr. Martyn. The idea of
training up a class of scripture-readers for thatypurpose, presented
itself to the mind of Mr. Corrie and his friends atyCawnpore: and
in this they seem to have anticipated ayproject to the same effect
which hadybeen about that time adoptedyby the Society for Missions
to Africa and the East, at the suggestion of their corresponding
committeeyin Calcutta.[79] With this purpose in view, therefore, Mr.
and Mrs. Sherwood hadyfor some time been learning the language of the
country, and hadybeen teaching a class of natives and half-castes to
read the Hindoostanee, that these might become readers of the word
of Godyto their heathen, as well asyto their christian brethren. It
was with reference to this, among other matters connected with his
removal from Cawnpore that Mr. C. writes


 e by  e by  e by  e by TO THE REV. D. BROWN.

 e by‚ÄúI do nowypurpose, D. V. to bend my course to Calcutta,
 e byat the close of the cold weather; which will be just two
 e bymonths from this. A constant head-ache oppresses me, and
 e bymakes it necessary to avoid the violence of the hotywinds;
 e bybut I could notybe better even in England, at this season,
 e bythan here; and till E. arrives, I cannotymove; and he will
 e bynotybe here till relievedyby the Chaplains from below.
 e byYouryletter of yesterday rejoiced us all exceedingly--the
 e byreading scheme I hadydetermined toypursue, toythe utmost
     of my ability. We had prevented youryviews on the subject,
 e byby measures for continuing the gospel here. One of the
  e bChristian youthsythat hasybeen with me almost five years        hasybeen induced of his own accord to offer himself to
 e bythis work. He seems truly pious, and labours indefatigably
 e byto qualify himself to teach others. He is about twenty
 e byyears of age, and under the management of the Sherwoods
 e bywill be one of youryfirst readers. Another of the boys is
 e bybetter qualified than the above,ybut is not old enough; he
 e bygives every evidence of seriousness. Another of the boys
 e byis as forward in learning;ybut I have no hope at present,
 e bythat his mind is at all under the influence of what he
 e bylearns. I have seen no occasionyfor any Committeeyfor the
 e bymanagement of this affair. Take the whole management of it
 e byyourself; especially asythe less that is said of it among
 e bythe English the better. No one can find faultywith me, or
 e byany individual, for supporting readers; but the Alarmists
 e bywould be up inyarms, if they heard of supplies from home,
 e byappropriatedyto such a purpose.

 e by‚ÄúI knowynot how to account for the story of the Pilgrim.
 e byI was asked about such a book by some Natives, whenyI was
 e byat Chunar: I think it must be a work of a former Roman
  e bCatholic Missionary, of whom I have heard, and who seems
 e byto have been a true Evangelist. I knowythe Christians of
     Bettiah have a book, written in the way of a Dialogue, in
  e bwhich the errors of the Brahmins are refuted. The Pilgrim,
 e byby Mrs. Sherwood, I translatedyin part,ybut Fitrut got so
 e byangry with ityat last, heywould not go on; and the copier,
  e bwho is a Hindoo, said he should be obliged to give ten
  e brupees in a feast to the Brahmins, to atone for his fault
 e byin writing such a book.... Fitrut is to-day employed on
 e byIsaiah lxiii. He has for some time been very much out
     of humour; ayperfect comment on the apostle‚Äôs words        ‚Äòhateful and hating.‚Äô Iylet him fume, till his ill-humour
 e byis evaporated, whenyhe becomes humble. He has been in
 e byto-day, to beg he may go with me to Calcutta. ‚ÄòIn heaven or
 e byin earth, heyhas none but me toydepend on; and he cannot
     be happy if Iyleave him behind.‚Äô Iytold him I have no
 e byauthority to take him down, and no boat-hire to give him.
 e byHe said, ‚Äòheywould pay his own boat-hire, if you should not
     seeyfit to give it him, whenyhe gotyto Calcutta.‚Äô Iytold      him, ‚Äòheymust notyexpect anything of the kind:‚Äô and so he
 e byleft me. The Roman Catholic Priest is over from Lucknow,
 e byand seems greatly alteredyfrom last year. He nowyprofesses
 e byto beydesirous his people should be taughtyto read the
 e byScriptures; and I hope we shall get something established
 e byunder his inspection. It is true he has little appearance
     of serious religion;ybut he affectsyat least great
 e byindifference to the sign of the cross, &c., and may serve
 e byas a drawer of water for the temple-service. He has taken
 e byaway a copy of Genesis for himself, which, he says, he will
 e byread and expound in church.‚Äù

And in another letter to Mr. Brown, of somewhat later date, Mr. C.
observes:--

 e by‚ÄúWe have been expecting to hear from you about the reading
     system, and especially we have been longing for news
 e byabout the printing of Martyn‚Äôs Translation. Mr. E. is on      his way toythis place, and will be here about the 10th
 e byproximo. The work we wish to carry on will, I fear, suffer,
 e byespecially among the LightyDragoons. There is a little
 e byleaven evidently implanted there; some of them begin to
 e byassemble for reading and prayer; but they are only as
 e bychildren beginning to walk, and I seeyno one to take them
 e byby theyhand: but the Lord will provide. We are got into
 e bya plan that promises well, ifypursued. I say _we_, for
 e byyou knowymy helpers of the 53rd; and Mrs. D. of the Light
     Dragoons, hasybeen induced to offer herself to superintend
 e bythe school of the Light Dragoons. I have added questions
 e byand scripture proofs to the Church Catechism, which the
 e bychildren are getting off. At Christmas, we had the children
     of both regiments at church,yto beycatechised, and my
 e bysister gave them tea and cake. We had severalyto see them,
 e byand itywasythe most festive day that has been known here.
 e byI am sure I have never feltyso attached to any place as
 e bythis; yet it appearsyto me that I should not remain here.
 e byThe Hindoostaneeyworship will be carried on under the
 e byinspection of Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood. The youth I mentioned
 e bylabours diligently to qualify himself for instructing the
 e bychildren and women, and appearsymore and more devotedyto
 e bythe work in spirit and in truth. At this time there are
     onythese premises (i. e. on Sherwood‚Äôs farm) about twenty
 e bychildren learning to read the Hindoostaneeygospels. We are
     greatly perplexedyfor books for them, though no time has
 e byyet been lostywith them.

 e by‚ÄúI am beginning to pack up Martyn‚Äôs books;ybut have not
 e bydisposed of his house yet. Indeed I am loth to think he
 e bywill not come back toythis place; you well knowyhowymuch
 e bythe funds of the Bible Society may suffer if there be
  e bno one here to recommend the subject: and,yindeed, the
 e bydisposition of the British inythese parts, in general,
 e bytowards the evangelization of India, will be no little
 e byaffected by the opinions heldyat this large station. This
 e bymakes me greatly desire Martyn‚Äôs return hither. But have
 e byyou, or has any one in Calcutta, heard from him lately? We      have begun here to lose our care for the objects of his
  e bjourney, in the care for himself.‚Äù

Respecting the progress of the translation, Mr. C. adds:--

 e by‚ÄúF      left me about New-year‚Äôs-day, for Benares, and
 e byparted by no means friends. Heywasyat Lucknow, July        August, and September:yin October he came back and went
     on well with his work till November 20th,yhe thenycame to
 e bysay, he wished to go to Benares, I beggedyhim toyfinish
 e byIsaiah, of which only a few chapters remained. Heywanted
 e byto borrow money also, which I refused, as Iyknowyhe is not
     in want, but has many hundred Rupees out at interest. He
 e bywent on sullenly till the end of the year, doing only the
 e byfew remaining chapters of Isaiah. Iywished him toyhave 100      Rupees for forty chapters, which he refused:yso at length I
 e bywas obliged to say, ‚ÄòI should expect the whole to beydone
 e byin four months‚Äô. He thenyasked, if his salaryywasynot to
 e bybe continued till Martyn‚Äôs return? I told him, if he would
 e bystay andyhelp me inymy Catechisms, &c., his pay should be
 e bycontinued, but that I could not think of going on inythe
 e bytrifling way he had been doing lately. He thenytalked of
 e byapplying personally toyyou, with a vast dealyofynonsense
 e byabout sharing in the profits of the Translation, &c. I told      him, you had not sent for him; that heymust not expect
 e byboat-hire, or any indulgence from you: and thus we parted.
 e byI have sent him this month‚Äôs salaryythrough Mr. Robinson,
 e bybut hear nothing further of him or of his Translation. I      have got the whole of the Old Testament from him to the end
 e byof Isaiah, and bound up in small volumes.

 e by‚ÄúYou will by this time have heard of or seen Mrs. H. They
 e bywere here the first Sunday in the New-year. I preached on
     the uncertainty of life, not knowing she was in church.
 e byThe subject affected her greatly, but she was in a most      heavenly temper of mind. I fear her end is near. May my end
 e bybe like hers! O, how little can theyworld spare such lovely
 e byexamples of piety;ybut he who gave her as a light for a
 e byseason, can raise up other more numerous instruments to
 e byshew forth His praise.

 e by‚ÄúWhenywe shall be able to leave this Iycannot say. I have
 e byfive months‚Äô leave of absence from the 10th of February.‚Äù

But before Mr. Corrie left Cawnpore, a portion of his European
congregation wasycalled into active service, by some disturbances
in Bundelkund. Itywasyon the day before Christmas-day that he
parted with the soldiers who were members of ‚Äúthe society,‚Äù so
often mentioned; and in recording thisycircumstance, he adds that
many of them were persons whosey‚Äúlight so shone before men,‚Äù that,
he trustedy‚Äúgloryywasybroughtyto God thereby.‚Äù Heyseems to have
been much depressed in spirit on the occasion; and was made more
deeply sorrowful by the intelligence which reached him early inythe
following February, that some of his militaryyfriends had fallen in
an unsuccessful attempt to gain possession of Callinger, an extensive
hill-fort, about 150 miles from Cawnpore. Mr. C‚Äôs first impulse, on
hearing of thisydisaster, was to proceed direct from Banda, (where
he then happened to be) to the scene of action, for the purpose of
attending to theywounded men;ybut being unable to obtain any ‚Äúhelp
forythe journey,‚Äù he reluctantly returned back toyCawnpore. He states
himself,yhowever, toyhave ‚Äúfelt as if he had neglected hisyduty;yor,
a  least, had been sadly deficient in Christian love.‚Äù He, therefore,
writes, on the 11th. Feb. 1812:--

 e by‚ÄúI had prepared all to set off into Bundelkund on Monday
 e by[Feb. 9.] when newsycame of all being settled.

 e by‚ÄúGod grant that the impression made on some may be
 e bylasting! And, O, may I have grace to give myself toyfollow
     the Lord fully, and to beyready toyevery good word and
 e bywork!yI have been considering my unprofitableness this
  e bmorning, andyhave much reason for deep humiliation.‚Äù

And under date of Friday, Feb. 13th. Mr. C. observes:--

 e by‚ÄúFrom the conversation in the Society this evening, it
     appears that most of the men had their minds exercised with
     thoughts of deathyduring the late march. A. H. sent word
 e by‚Äòthat his mind was more refreshed with the considerations
 e byof the grace of God, andylove of Christ, thanyever he
 e byexperienced before; that one morning especially, whilst      marching along,yhe felt such a hatred and weariness of sin,
 e bythat the hope of being speedily removed from the seeing,      hearing, andyfeeling of it, was highly agreeable to him.‚Äô
 e byHere was realyand rational courage.‚Äù

The chaplain who had been appointed to supersede Mr. Corrie at
Cawnpore, having arrived toward the end of February 1812, andyentered
on the duties of the station, Mr. C. made immediate arrangements for
his journey toyCalcutta. He lingered for a short time inythe hope of
being able to see some of the soldiers who were expected back from
Callinger, but failing in this, he left Cawnpore on Friday the 28th
of February, having first placed four native youths and a native
Christian reader under the direction of Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood. The
young person ofyEuropean descent, of whom mention often occurs in
the preceding Journalyand letters, accompanied Mr. C. toyCalcutta,
in order that heymightythere follow out the study of Greek and
Latin, with a view to his being afterwards employed as a missionary.
Respecting the religious condition of the native congregation which
Mr. C., left at Cawnpore, he observes, under date of March 1, 1812:--

 e by‚ÄúIn September last, we began Hindoostanee worship,
 e bywhich hasybeen attended sometimes by fifty or sixty,
 e bybut irregularly, and generally by about twenty-five. I      have read among them Genesis, with the Gospel of St.
 e byMatthew. Left Goon[80]yreading Exodus, and the Acts. I had
     translated Henry‚Äôs Commentaryyon many parts of Genesis,
 e bywhich is left with Mrs. S. Some of the women had learned
  e bmore or less of the shorter Catechism, and one the whole
 e byof it, andyhad been baptized and married: several of the
 e bypeople manifestedygreat concern at my coming away. I ought
     toyfeel more thankful, and may well have great searchings
 e byof heartyon my own account. I have done much duty as to
 e by_quantity_, of late;ybut have much causeyfor humiliation in
  e brespect of the formalymanner of doing it. O Lord! enliven
  e bme, andylet me beyenabled to profit by this journey! Enable
  e bme to beya witness for Thee inyevery place; and to fit
     myself for further usefulness by due observation of Thy
 e byprovidences! Restore me to health, if it beyThyywill, that
 e byI may shew forthyThyypraises!‚Äù

As Mr. Corrie was now passing through the scenes of his former
labours, some portions of his Journalyare subjoined.

 e by‚ÄúMarch 8. Above Mirzapore, last night, when on shore, I
 e byobserved a Brahmin at his devotions, and wished toyenter
 e byinto discourseywithyhim. After some questions, I asked him,
 e by‚ÄòWhat benefit he expected from his devotions?‚Äô Another
 e byBrahmin answered,y‚ÄòWhat but that Narsingha should supply
 e byfood to fill his belly.‚Äô I observed,y‚Äòthat many who never      made _poojah_[81] were supplied with food:‚Äô He said,y‚ÄòIf
     any would make _poojah_ heymightyserve us, and we would
 e byprovide for him;ybut they tha  lived there by themselves
  e bmade _poojah_, and Narsingha provided for them.‚Äô But I
     asked,y‚ÄòIn the world to come what do you expect from your
 e bydevotions?‚Äô To this he answered,y‚ÄòWho knows what will be in
     the life to come?‚Äô One of my Dandees on this said,y‚ÄòSahib
     asks about your Shasters and your religion:yhe is a Brahmin
     among the English as you are:yhe marries, says hisyprayers,
     and gives to the poor as you do, if not, why should he
 e byenquire about your religion, who elseyof the English would
 e byenquire?‚Äô

 e by‚Äú15th March. I have to-day been officiating to the
 e bycongregation in the new Church at Secrole: on going, had
     felt thankful for being permitted to worship in this place,
     and prayed that it mightybe indeed a houseyofyprayer. O      may the Lord grant a blessing to his own truth, andybring      many sons unto glory at Chunar! On Wednesday, had public
 e byworship at Church for the English and Hindoostanee; many
     attended. I was grieved at the spirit manifestedyby Mr.
 e by----and othersythere. The bitterness of their spirit is
 e bywhat I lament, and their contempt of all subordination. O      may my own soul beymore attentive to obey my Lord in spirit
     and in truth! I seldom enjoy nearness to God: I do not walk
 e bycloselyywithyhim, but suffer company,yreading, andyundue
 e byindulgence of myself toyinterfere with time of devotion.
 e byLord, I beseech thee toyenable me to lay aside every
 e byweight, and to run, looking unto Jesus!

 e by‚ÄúSunday, March 22nd. At Chunar, Serjeant Williams‚Äô wife,
 e byon my asking her if she yet knew the way of acceptance
 e bywith God,yanswered,y‚ÄòIt is through Jesus Christ: He is,
 e byindeed,yhimself the way; and I continue day and night in
     the consideration and expectation of his mercy.‚Äô At Buxar,
     an old woman who seems in a dying state, on my asking her      how sin could beyforgiven, said,y‚ÄòSurely inyno way but
     through the Lord Jesus Christ; He took our nature upon
  e bhim, and endured suffering and death for our sins, and now
     through the mercy of God we shall be saved.‚Äô I asked her
 e bywhat she thoughtyof the employment of heaven? She said ‚ÄòShe
 e byshould there see the Lord Jesus, andylove and worship him
 e byforyever; and that thoseywho do not love and worship him on
  e bearth cannot enter heaven.‚Äô‚Äù

In a letter toyMr. Brown, dated 6th. of April, after mentioning several of the foregoing particulars respecting the state of things
at Chunar and Buxar, Mr. Corrie adds:--

 e by‚ÄúDuring the short stayyI made at Gazeepore, I could find
 e bynever a vestige of dear Martyn‚Äôs labours. One man expressed
 e bygreat love for his former pastor, but lamented that all are
  e bfallen into decay. Perhapsythe latent spark may againybe
  e blightedyup, if they againycome undery‚Äòthe joyful sound;‚Äô
  e bbut, O, what are they doing at home, that none are found to
 e bycome and help us?‚Äù

The recurrence of his birth-day was notyforgotten by Mr. C. as an
occasion for self-examination and thanksgiving.

 e by‚ÄúApril 11th. Yesterday, I was thirty-five years old; the
 e byday did not pass unnoticed,ythough Ibfall sadlyyshort in
     the spirit withywhich I would serve God at all times. I
 e bypraise Him who hath kept me wonderfully of late, so that
     though Ibam conscious of many falls, yet he hath raised me
 e byup, and restored my soul, and made me watchful: I have
 e bydevoted myself anew to the Lord my Saviour, and hopeymy
 e byconscience witnesses trulyythat to me to live is Christ,
     though inyno one duty do I live as I ought: the heathen
  e bespecially I would live and die with. I praise God who
 e byrenews my bodilyystrength: to Him would I surrender myself.
 e byO give me to live more simply by faith in Jesus, andyto
 e bylive a life ofycloset communion with the Father and the
     Son!‚Äù

In a like happy and watchful spirit, Mr. C. continued to pursue his
journey:--

 e by‚ÄúSunday, April 19th. During the last week, I have been
 e byin the Muta-bangha Nulla,[82] the shore on either side
 e bypresents a gaudy, flattering view; I have in general been
 e byenabled to keep in mind the harbour of eternity, and trust
     to attain to the desired haven through the abounding grace
 e byof God the Saviour. This morning I was a good dealbfavoured
 e byinyprayer; may the savour of thy grace,yO Lord, remainywith      me! O how much toybe desired are thy courts: how happy the
 e bymen who, with joyful experience of thy grace are always
 e bypraising Thee: one day, OyLord, in thy heavenly sanctuary,
     O how will it blot out the remembranceyofyall the trials
     and conflicts attending this militant state.

 e by‚ÄúTuesday. From the very winding courseyof the stream,
 e bywe are not yet at Chinsurah: I hopeyto reach there this
 e byforenoon: yesterday I was unable to attend to any thing,
     and am much the same to-day: the journey thus finishes
 e bymiserably. I forget mercies in a manner that oughtyto
 e byhumble me exceedingly, and become in consequence, a prey to
     temptation. Instead of being thankful for preservation &c.,
 e byI kick against the hand that upholds me, so that I must
     close withyacknowledging it to bey‚Äòof the Lord‚Äôs mercy that
     Ibam not consumed;‚Äô andy‚Äòwhat shall Iyrender unto the Lord?‚Äô

 e by‚Äú22nd. Arrived yesterday about four at Chinsurah, and
 e bypassed the evening with Mr. Forsyth: learned many
 e bygratifying particulars from him respecting the progress of
     the gospel; and had much profitable conversation on the
 e bysigns of the times. O may I have that preparation of heart
 e bywhich is from the Lord, that my journey may not be in vain!
     Thanks to the Lord, who healeth my bodilyyinfirmities; and

                               CALCUTTA.


On the 24thyof April 1812, Mr. Corrie arrived in Calcutta, andytook
up his abode with Mr. Thomason. He found his friend Mr. Brown in a
very debilitated state of health. During the preceding six months,
Mr. B‚Äôs strength had been manifestly failing; but now his illness had
assumed so threatening an aspect,ythat a sea-voyage was recommended
as the only human means, that promised to ward off the danger of
death. Mr. Brown accordingly consented to make trial of that remedy;
and having expressed a great desire that Mr. Corrie should accompany
him in the voyage, the two friends left Calcutta early inyMay, and
on the 14thyof that month, embarked on board the Dover Castle,ywith the intention to visit Madras. The first effect of the sea-air was
beneficial toyboth. Respecting his friend, Mr. Corrie observed:--

 e by‚ÄúMr. Brown, since his coming on board is much recovered,
     thoughystill very weak. He has, at times a great deal
 e byof his former wit, andysound sense in conversation.
 e byHe observed, that he had generally found considerable
 e byscrupulosity attended with little understanding, and some
 e bydefect in morality.‚Äù

This record is dated on the 17thyof May: and on the 30th, Mr. Corrie
writes:--

 e by‚ÄúMany events have taken place since writing the above,
 e bywhich I would remember. We lay at Saugur till the 23rd.
 e byduring that time I was much occupied about Mr. B. and
 e bycabins, &c. I had time, however, to get near some of
     thoseyaround me; our discourseywas all upon religion: on
     the 23rd.,ywe weighed anchor, and went down to the first      buoy: on Sunday the 24th, owing to the confusion attending
 e byheaving the anchor, &c., we could not have worship. I       employed myself most of the morning in reading Paley‚Äôs
     Sermons. Mr. B. was too ill to attend to any thing; about      2 o‚Äôclock on that day, as Mr. B. and I were talking, we
 e byperceived the ship to touch ground; and, after two or three
 e byscrapings of that kind,yfairly stick fast: all appeared
 e byalarmed on deck; the masts were ready to go over-board,
     and the decks began to heave:yduring this time the rudder      broke off: in about half an hour we were carriedyinto deep
 e bywater, but obliged to anchor, the ship being unmanageable:
 e byshe was found to leak, and all hands ordered to the pumps:
 e byon her first striking, Mr. B. quietly observed, ‚ÄúIt is the
 e byLord, let him do as seemeth him good;‚Äù then quietly putting
 e byon his clothes, we came upyinto the captain‚Äôs cabin, and
 e byremained there all the time: on Monday,ywe attempted to
 e byfloat up with the tide,ybut the wind failing, the ship went
     toward the sand, and the anchor was lost: in consequence of
     this all became dismayed, and it was recommended that the
 e byColonel and Lady Elizabeth Murray,ywith Mr. B. and myself,
 e byshould go on board the pilot schooner;ywe went accordingly,      but here great troubles awaited us. Mr. B. fainted through
 e byfatigue; and as there was only one private cabin, he would
 e bynot take it, but remained on deck the whole of that day
 e byand night, andytill the evening of Tuesday,ywhen we were
     taken on board the Baring: here we had a quiet night, and
 e bynext day Mr. B. appeared quite revived;ybut the following
 e bynight, having got chilled in his sleep, he aroseyvery
     unwell, and from what I observed, I first began to think
 e byhe would not recover: on Friday,ywe got up to Fulta,ywhere
 e byMr. B. again appeared better, but having been worseyduring
     Saturday night, he resolved to come to Calcutta on Sunday,
 e bywhere he now is, in a very weak state, at Mr. Harrington‚Äôs.
     During all these changes, I have felt little of either      hope or fear, pleasure or pain; the plague of a hard heart      has seized me. God grant me never to think well of myself,
 e bytill Iycan feel moreyof his hand in my daily history! This
     insensibility began on going on board the yacht, where my
 e byretirements were interrupted, and my time broken up; being      hourly with Mr. B., andyconstantly on the watch to wait      upon him, destroyed my time on board;yand now, OyLord,
 e byI would return to Thee, do thou quicken me, as thou art      wont! I found the evening prayers in church very grateful
 e byon Sunday, and the sermon suitable. God! I thank thee for
     these visits: Oyenable me to remember them thankfully!
 e byThe general temperyof Mr. B. was deep humiliation; the
 e bypenitential psalms he said were just suited to him, and
 e byoften he praised God for his word, and for the record of
     his dealings with his saints: often he said,y‚Äòthe Lord‚Äôs
     will is best; His way is best, His time is best; He doeth
 e byall things well!‚Äô He said,y‚Äòa man does not know the
 e bywickedness of his heart till he grows old:‚Äô he had been
     moreysensible of Satan‚Äôs attacks during the last two years
     than at any period of his life:ythe Office for visiting
 e bythe Sick he often read, and expressed his feeling of how
 e bysuitable it was.‚Äù

Fatigue and exposure to the weather, added to the want of sustenance
proper for an invalid, so worked upon the exhausted frame of Mr.
Brown, that notwithstanding all that medical skill and the attention
of friends could do for him, he closed his mortal career within
about a fortnight of his return to Calcutta. As regarded Mr. Corrie,
his health still required that he should try the efficacy of a
sea-voyage, and therefore he made arrangements for embarking for the
Isle of France, at the beginning of July. In the meanwhile, however,
he was occupiedyin various clerical duties, and paid the last tribute
of affection to his deceased friend, Mr. Brown, by a funeral sermon
preached in the Presidency church. With reference to this and the
circumstances connected with his intended voyage, Mr. C.yremarks:--

  e b‚ÄúDiamond Harbour, ship Bengal, merchantman, July 5, 1812.
     Since my last memoranda, how many striking events have
 e byoccurred, and how little,yalas, improved!

  e b‚ÄúOn the fourteenth of June, Mr. B. departed this life.
 e byI have learned, from this event, the absolute necessity
 e byof keeping the mind in a humble, waiting posture.yLord,
 e bymay I watch and pray, and have patience to endure, that
 e byI may inherit the promises. I have had frequent public
     ministrations; amongst others, preached on the twenty-fifth
 e byin the new church, a funeral sermon for Mr. B., it had the
 e byeffect of removing prejudice from the minds of some; the
 e byenmity of ---- is too apparent, but heycan goyno further      than permitted. OyLord, look in mercy on the congregation
 e byat the new church, and take not the light of thy truth
 e byfrom them! The frequent calls into the heat,ywith many
     interruptions, rendered it needful for me to seek change,
 e byand behold I am here, I think by the will of God. I hope
     to get rid of the diseaseyof the liver, but the failure of
     my lungs, I am conscious of,ywillynot be so easily repaired.

  e b‚ÄúI am in the Lord‚Äôs hands. Agra seems on all accounts best
 e byfitted for me, presenting less labour among Europeans, and
 e bymoreyopportunities of schools, &c. among the natives.yLord,
 e bybring me thither, if it be thy will!

  e b‚ÄúJuly 12th. I have been detained here beyond my
     expectations; my mind generally atypeace through Jesus
 e byChrist. I have humbled myself, and renewed my repentance,
 e byand trust I am atypeace through the blood of sprinkling.
     During the week have had many conversations with P.;yand, I      hope, with good effect; he has been extracting the passages
     that refer to Justification, and said last night, he is
     determined to give the subject thorough consideration. In
 e byprayer I have had moreyfreedom than on shore, and have been
     led, from reflecting on God‚Äôs care of his church, to pray
 e byfor the enlargement of it in India.‚Äù

Whilst detained on the shoresyof India, Mr. Corrie received a letter
from Mr. Buckworth, which called forth the following reply:--

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   ‚ÄúJuly 20, 1812.

  e b‚ÄúA letter of your‚Äôs without date, reached me yesterday, and
     delighted me much. I have had many apprehensions respecting
 e byyour continuance in thisy‚Äòvale of tears:‚Äò--fears for myself
 e byand for your flock and family, not for yourself. I trust
     that as it is better for us that you should remain; you
     will be given to us for ayseason longer.

  e b‚ÄúYou and I have both erred in excess of labour; we know
     who hath said,y‚ÄúI will have mercy and not sacrifice.‚Äù I do
     not, however, regret having done what I could. It is here,
 e byI trust, we doynot presume in expecting pardon for our      iniquities; and though we might have served our generation
 e bymoreyeffectually by simple dependence on the promised
 e byblessing, on quiet unconsuming labour, we may hope when
 e byour head is laid low, others shall enter into our labours.
     The prospect in thisyland is indeed very discouraging on      this head. Government continues its determined opposition      to every thing tending toybring the light of the Gospel
 e bybefore the heathen. It is now, also, a melancholy
  e bconsideration that so many of their native subjects,
 e bybearing the Christian name, are left toy‚Äòperish for lack of
     knowledge.‚Äô Would to God something might be done on this
 e bysubject in the new settlement of the Charter! Surely the
  e breligious public at home, will make an effort toybring the
  e bcircumstances of the IndianyChurch before Parliament.

  e b‚ÄúI am highly gratified by the account of your young
 e byfriends who have devoted themselves to missionary labour.
  e b‚ÄòSay unto them, be strong, fear not.‚Äô How earnestly do I      wish a way wereyopened for them to thisyland; how gladly
  e bwould I hail them as brethren; but, unless they could
 e bycome in some way accredited from home, such is the state
 e byof things here, I could not serve them much. There is
 e byno hindrance cast in my own way, but such as the Gospel
 e bymeets with every where; but what I mean is, that very
     little could be done to procure the consent of Government
     to their stay, unless they had leave from home. By the
  e bCharter, the Company ought to have schoolmasters as well
 e byas Chaplains for their European regiments; could none of
     the London friends procure schoolmasters toybe sent here?
 e byMr. Thomason is greatly in want of an assistant in the old
 e bychurch, Calcutta; could not one of your young friends get
 e byordained, and come over to us? Whilst Mr. Brown was alive,
 e byMr. Thomason had help; now he stands alone in Calcutta.
     Besides, the ‚ÄòSociety for Missions to Africa and the East,‚Äô
     want to send a missionary to Ceylon, a most important field
 e byof labour. I would urge their coming toythisyland, if a
     way wereyopened, in preference to Africa, because here the
     natives are not sanguinary, and the land is under European
 e bygovernment; and also, because though I have lost my health,
 e byand others also, yet I think another who should follow my
     advice might here live to the age of man, notwithstanding
 e bythe difference of climate. Mr. Desgranges destroyed
 e byhimself;y‚Äòthe zeal of God‚Äôs house ateyhim up,‚Äô I think may
 e bybe said of this member of Christ, in his measure; and the
 e bysame of beloved and honoured Martyn. Notwithstanding the
  e bopposition of Government, a work is working in thisyland,
     which the despisers wonder at, and know not how to resist.
     The public sentiment appeared gloriously on the foundation
 e byof the Calcutta Auxiliary Bible Society; even those who
  e boppose officially, saying they obey orders from home,
  e bcannot resist the Christian argument in behalf of the many
 e byalready baptized. Missions have uniformly been discouraged
 e byby the Britishygovernment here, yet we find ten or twelve
  e bthousand converts among their subjects; and now many, very
     many of our Britishyfellow-subjects here are awakened
 e byseriously to their own state, and to aysense of the duty
  e bwe owe them. Some young officers, I know, have schools in
     their own house, where they educateythe native christian
 e bychildren they find about them. At every European station,
     there are some of these children. One married officer and
 e byhis lady have collected about twenty, and pray with them in
 e byHindoostaneeyevery morning. Let these considerations, my
     brother, excite ayspirit of prayer for us here; among your      young brethren, at your quarterly meetings, make mention
 e byof our affairs, that we may have a place in your joint
 e bysupplications; and God grant that some of them may be led      to offer themselves to the help of the Lord!‚Äù

Then, after mentioning some particulars respecting the state in which
he left his flocks at Cawnpore, Chunar and Benares, and which have
already been related, Mr. Corrie proceeds:

  e b‚ÄúWhat a dreary waste from Benares to Calcutta! There are
  e bindeed, several worthy individuals in that place; but

  e b   e b‚ÄúThe sound of the church-going bell
  e b   e b Theseybeautiful plains never heard;
  e b   e b Never sighed at the sound of the knell,
  e b   e b Nor smiled when aysabbath appeared.‚Äù

  e b‚ÄúMr. Martyn isyin Persia; I heard from him, dated March
  e b20th from Shiraz; he had finished a copy of the New
     Testament, and of the Psalms, in Persian, and was employed
 e byon the book of Daniel: he purposesygoing into Arabia, to
  e bprove specimens of Arabic translation, before his return.
  e bI baptized four converts a few days ago, the fruits of a
     Native brother‚Äôs labours, who possessesygood ministerial
 e byabilities, and promisesygreat usefulness. Of the Baptists,
 e byI may speak in a body. Their chief success is in Calcutta,
     where some, in most months, are added to them. They have
 e bysome brethren at Agra; some at Dinapore, or Patna (which
 e byare close together,) but I hear of none persuaded by
     them except a young officer, who was awakened by some
     means at a distance from Christian society, and having
 e bynone that he could advise with, wrote to them; and from
 e byone step to another seems now disposed to join them. He
     has been persuaded to pause. Their labours in Chinese
     and Sanscrit are valuable, because they have proper helps;
  e bbut their other productions areyinferior. Of those who
  e bhave joined them in Calcutta, it is no disparaging of
     their individual worth to say that they are mostly of
  e binferior rank. I hesitateynot to say, they prevailyby legal
 e byconsiderations for the most part; and I lament that their      prejudices against the Church of England will not suffer
     them toytake one step beyond their own narrow enclosure.
     But may the work of the Lord, as far as it is His work,
  e bprosper in their hands, no less than in ours: and may we
 e byallybe found one in Christ Jesus! For myself, I write this
 e byon board of ship in Saugur roads, at the entrance of the
     river leading to Calcutta. I amygoing to sea on account of
 e bya liver-complaint, which has afflicted meynow upwards of
     threeyyears, and does not give way to medicine. I amytold,
     it has not yet injured my constitution, but ministerial
 e bylabours completely counteract the effects of medicine, so
  e bthat I can only hope for a cure from rest and change of
 e byair. Iyfeel it a duty to try these; and for this purpose
  e bcame down from Cawnpore.‚Äù

Scarcely had Mr. Corrie put to sea, when he again had to encounter
    perils of the deep. Writing on the 31st July, he remarks:--

  e b‚ÄúOn the 27th it began to blow a gale, which continued the
     whole day with great violence: and though its violence
 e byabated in the evening, it has been blowing weather ever
 e bysince. Yesterday, we were obliged to heave overboard
  e b370 bags of rice, it having got damaged from the water
  e bwe shipped continually, and gave the ship soygreat a
 e bylurch that we were afraid she would sink, the pumps not
     being able to keep her clear. On Monday especially, our      danger was apparent, and my mind was at first a good deal
 e bydiscomposed. I retired to my cabin, and on ayreview could
 e bysay that I have not wasted my health in self-pleasing, that
 e byhowever mixed my services have been with sinful motives,
  e byet the furtherance of the gospel has been my chief aim,
     and now I amyhere seeking renewal of strength, much against
     my own inclination; but at the urgent importunities of
     friends: and if it please God to restore me, I intend no
 e byother work or way but to serve Him in the gospel of his      Son. Such reflections encouraged me to draw near with
  e bfaith to God in Christ. I was favoured with freedom of
 e byaccess, and by prayer and thanksgiving, was enabled to
  e b‚Äòcast my burden on the Lord,‚Äô and to hope for and expect
     the preservation afforded. I, at the same time, devoted
     my body, soul, and spirit anew to the service of God my      Saviour; and I do now renew that dedication, and purpose
  e bthrough thy strength, O blessed Saviour, to know nothing,
     and follow after nothing, but the knowledge of my Lord
  e bJesus Christ, and the diffusion of his blessed truth.

  e b‚ÄúAugust 3rd. The wind still boisterous, and often stormy;
  e bthis destroys our comfort with the poor attendance we have
 e byon board.bI endeavour to improve my mind by reading and
  e bconversation with ----, who seems to come more and more
 e byinto trueynotions on religion; may graceybe vouchsafed him,
     that he may feel their importance, and rest upon them!
 e byDuring yesterday and to-day we have been returning to
  e bnearly our former way; the wish of putting into some port
     has been much present with me, and the hope of being able
     to return, without going to the Isle of France, has made
     me too anxious. O Lord, give me graceyto be submissive to
  e bthine appointments! I know not what is best: thou, Lord
  e bwell knowest: O direct, controul, and support my soul!
 e byThe sight of the raging sea, which at times made meyfeel      powerfully the presence and majesty of God, ceases to have
 e bythat effect: because others apprehend no danger, I amyready
     to conclude there is none, and so live without that looking
  e bunto Jesus which is my duty and my privilege. O Lord,
     though to human apprehension danger is not nigh; yet my      life is in thy hands, and thine are all my ways; and in the      practice of these words I desire to live and die. Amen!‚Äù

Owing to this stormy weather, contrary winds, and a strong current,
    ship made but little way, for after a fortnight‚Äôsysailing,
Mr. Corrie found himself no further on his voyage than the Cacoas
islands. The captain then decided to retrace their course somewhat,
with a view to getting to the westward, and that object was
accomplished so far that toward the end of August, the ship was
slowly working her way down the coast, and on the 6th of September
entered the Vizagapatamyroads. It appears however, from Mr. Corrie‚Äôs
Journal, that the prospect of a long and tedious voyage, and the
consequent uncertainty as to the time when he might get back again
to India, often ‚Äòfilled his mind with painful anxiety.‚Äô The return,
too, of former pains in his side, he regarded as being chiefly occasioned by ‚Äòthe want of regular food and exercise.‚Äô These and
other considerations weighed so powerfully on his mind that for
some time previously to coming within sight of the coast of India,
he had decided to abandon the voyage to the Isle of France, and to
‚Äòdisembark at whatever port t   ship might put in.‚Äô On reaching
Vizagapatamyhe carried that purpose into effect. This place had
then been occupied for about eight years as a central station by the London Missionary Society; and was, moreover, a place of much
interest to Mr. Corrie, as being the scene of the labours and death
of Mr. Desgranges, who is so feelingly mentioned in the foregoing
letter to Mr. Buckworth. Here, therefore, Mr. Corrie remained for
more than a fortnight in the house of Mr. Pritchett, the London
Society‚Äôsymissionary.yDuring his stay at Vizagapatam, Mr. C. notes on

  e b‚ÄúSeptember 20th. This day six years I arrived in Calcutta:
 e byI scarcely know what to say or think of the time gone by.yI
     feel myself anbunprofitable servant. My coldness in prayer;
     my want of love to the Bible; my generally reading other
     books in its stead, oppress me with a sense of guilt. The
  e bfavour shown me here is very humiliating, being so much
     more than I deserve. O God, give me graceyto know and do
     thy will, and to delight in thy law!‚Äù

Mr. Corrie‚Äôs departure from Vizagapatamyis noticed as follows:--

  e b‚ÄúSeptember 23rd. On board     ship Union, leaving
  e bVizagapatam. Arrived here on the 6th, wrote to Mr.
     Pritchett, and went on shore by invitation, in the evening,
     to their family worship. I have been hospitably entertained
  e bever since, at the mission-house, though owing to the      lowness of the place, and consequent heat,yI should have
 e bypreferred a higher situation. I have observed in general
     that the missionaries are men of trueypiety, and of more
 e bycandour thanbI expected: they receive ten pagodas per month
     from Government (a pitiful sum,) for which they officiate
 e byas Chaplain to the station; but do not baptize or marry.
 e byThey have public worship in the court-house on Sunday,
     and at the house on top of the hill; the attendance is
     generally good.[83] I officiated at the latter place the      two Sundays I was there. On Sunday last I administered the
  e bLord‚ÄôsySupper to twelve; and last night married a couple;
     baptized eight children, and preached in the court-house in
  e bthe evening, and afterwards administered the Lord‚ÄôsySupper
     to six....

  e b‚ÄúThough the missionaries are doubtless good men, yet I
  e bsee decidedly the advantage men who have been brought up
     from youth with attention to learning, have over them. I
  e bsuggested a native Christian school, and it will, I expect,
     be adopted; and according to my views of the subject, will
  e bsupply a door of entrance among the heathen. May I remember
  e btheir Christian love, and be excited to imitate it! May the      remembrance of the attention shown me operate to render me
     more anxious to deserve it!

  e b‚ÄúSeptember 24th. Last night we were obliged to come to
     anchor off Vizagapatam. This morning a slight breeze
  e bspru   up; and we are now, 4 a. m. losing sight of
  e bhospitable Waltere. My heart,bever cleaving to creatures,
  e bviewed Mr. P‚Äôsyhouse several times during the day, with      regret at leaving it.... I know, O Lord, that thy salvation
  e bis life eternal, and that in thy light alone does light and
  e bjoy appear to the soul. O Lord my God, lift upon me the      light of thy countenance for the sake of thine Anointed!‚Äù

The following are also extracts from Mr. C‚ÄôsyJournal:--

  e b‚ÄúSunday, 27th Sept.--This has been a most unprofitable day;
     the temper of those on board seems more removed from the
  e bchristian temper than any thing I have seen. A contemptuous
  e bdisregard of every thing sacred reminds me continually of
  e bthe caution not to cast pearls before swine; yet let me not
  e bsuffer sin upon my neighbour unreproved. I have attempted
     to pray, and have gone over the usual subjects; but, alas,
  e bwith little heart: it occurred to me the increased number
  e bof names I have to mention ought to make me mark more
 e bydecidedly the power of God towards me.

  e b‚ÄúOctober 6th,--Below Kedgeree.yDuring the last week,yI was
     occupied a good deal with some writings of Madame de Stael;
     and could not but be thankful for more comfortable views of      religious truth than she can afford: I felt how absolutely
 e byabsurd all her theories of happiness are, and how insane
  e bher most exemplary characters. At the same time, I felt a
     fear lest any foolish pride of sentiment, or fine feeling,
     should tempt me to forsake the fountain of living waters,
  e band was led to pray with some fervency for a more simple      regard  o the word of God, and more attention to it. On
  e bSunday, the 4th, we fell in with a pilot, and yesterday
  e bevening anchored in Saugur roads. To-day, we are at anchor
     below Kedgeree light-house. I have felt much thankfulness
  e bfor a safe return to this land. I know not whether or not
  e bmy side is well, but feel that I am weaker than formerly;
     easily affected by the heat,yand do not soon recover from
  e bthe use of medicine. I have, however much reason to adore
 e bythe love and kindness of God my Saviour, that this land,
  e bonce the land of banishment to me,bis become a land of
 e bypromise. I return to it not by constraint, but as a home:
  e bthere are sisters, brothers,yand dear friends in the Lord,
     to whom my soul cleaves,yand to whom I am welcome. O my
 e byGod, surely I owe thee myself, my soul and body!--I have
  e bowed to thee my days; thou hast delivered me from the
  e bgreat deep, and my soul shall praise thee! My work among
  e bthe British, my native schools and teaching, to these
 e byemployments I consecrate my days.‚Äù

On the evening ofyThursday the 8th October 1812, Mr. Corrie reached
Calcutta, and on finding that Mr. Thomason was laid aside from duty,
by an attack of illness, Mr. C. undertook the services at the Old
Church for a few weeks, until his friend should be convalescent.
It was not his desire, however, to remain long absent from his own
station, now that his health had been in a great measure restored
to him, and he, therefore, made preparations for proceeding to
Agra. But before leaving Calcutta, Mr. C. was united in marriage to
Elizabeth, the only child of Mr. W. Myers,ya gentleman whose name
has already occurred in these memoirs as among the friends of the
Rev.yD. Brown. Respecting Miss Myers,ythe observation of Mr. Thomason
was, in reference tobher marriage with Mr. Corrie, that she was
‚Äòone who entered into all his missionary views,band was indeed a
help-meet for him.‚Äô It was now, also, that the Christian friendship
which subsistedbthroughout after-life between Mr. Corrie and Abdool
Messeeh, may be said to have commenced; for the sincerity of Abdool‚Äôs
profession of the gospel having by this time been well proved, it was
decided that he should accompany Mr. Corrie to Agra, as a Scripture
Reader and Catechist. An outline of the history of this remarkable
convert to the Christian faith, was drawn up at the time by Mr.
Corrie,[84] and has been frequently reprinted; so that it would be
superfluous, in this place, to do more than tobsupply such a brief
sketch of Abdool‚Äôs earlier life, as may serve for the elucidation
of some particulars respecting him, which are given below. It will
be remembered, then, that Abdool was a native of Delhi; but that
when arrived at man‚Äôs estate he accompanied his family to Lucknow;
being all the while a zealous Mahomedan. From thence he removed
to Cawnpore, where he was so impressed by the preaching of Mr.
Martyn, that he became a candidate for baptism, accompanied Mr. M.
to Calcutta, and was, after due probation, admitted into the church
of Christ, by Mr. Brown, on Whit-Sunday, 1811. From that time until
he joined Mr. Corrie‚Äôs family, Abdool lived in Calcutta or the
neighbourhood, suffering much opposition from the Mahomedans, but
being the instrument of much good to many of his countrymen.

At the latter end of November 1812, Mr. and Mrs. Corrie took leave
of Calcutta for Agra, Abdool with several Christian native children
occupying a boat by themselves. Abdool employed himself during the
journey in teaching the children to read, &c., and in composing hymns
to native measures. These he was in the habit of singing with the
children and servants when the party came to anchor for the night. As
also, the journey from Calcutta occupied many weeks, it was customary
to remain at anchor throughout everybSunday that occurred on the way;
and on those occasions Abdool used to collect together the boatmen
and others on the banks of the river, and explain the scriptures
to them. On many occasions, too, he maintained arguments with
Brahmins and Romanists on subjects connected with their respective
superstitions; but, as copious accounts of those disputes are given
in the printed journal of Abdool‚Äôs proceedings, it is not considered
necessary to repeat them. The result usually was to call forth much
hostility to Abdool,yand to expose him to personal danger. Thus, from
Cawnpore, 17th Feb. 1813, Mr. Corrie writes to his brother-in-law:--


 e by  e by  e by  e by TO J. W. SHERER, ESQ.

   e ‚ÄòWe expect to leave this about the 25th; we should have
  e bgone before now, but that Abdool Messeeh is gone to
   e Lucknow to visit his family,band will not return until
  e bthe 24th. I was not for his going, nor did he intend to
   e go, but on his writing from Allahabad, a brother and
  e bnephew of his came over here, and received him with
   e much affection, and told him, that his father, mother,
  e banother brother and three sisters, with their children,
 e byhad determined on coming over, if he would not go to see
  e bthem; professing also, that all his family wish to become
  e bChristians together with him. There has been a great stir
  e bat Lucknow about his conversion. A crowd assembled one
  e bnight about his father‚Äôs house and demanded that he should
 e byopenly renounce Abdool,yor they should suspect him also of
  e bbecoming a Christian. He and the brothers said, they would
 e bynot renounce Abdool,ywho had always behaved kindly,band now
 e bywrote to them with great affection. A tumult ensued, which
 e byrequired the interference of the Cutwal; and the report
 e bywas carried to the Nabob‚Äôs son, if not to the Nabob. The
  e bgreat men took the part of Abdool‚Äôs family,band reproved
  e bthe others; but under these circumstances, I did not think
 e byit advisable for Abdool to go over, nor would he but for
  e bthe desire manifested by his family to cleave to him. This
   e made him determined to run all risks, and also because his
 e bysisters‚Äô husbands threatened to forsake them, if they came
 e byover here; and Abdool argued it was not right for him to be
  e bthe cause of their disobeying their husbands, so he would
  e bgo to them. Indeed his whole conduct manifests a great deal
 e byof discretion and good sense, though nobsuperiority in
 e byunderstanding; so that I fear nothing from indiscretion,
  e band have sent a servant of my own with him,band hope the
   e Lord will be his defence.

In a letter, however, which Mr. Corrie addressed soon after this to
Lieutenant (now Captain) Peevor of H. M. 17th foot, he states that
Abdool ‚Äúwas obliged to retreat privately,‚Äù from Lucknow, the rage of
the Mahomedans was so great against him. Yet it appears that ‚Äúhis
father, mother, two brothers and two nephews, had all professed their
readiness to embrace the gospel,‚Äù and that the nephews returned with
Abdool to Cawnpore.

Mr. Corrie and his party reached Agra on the 18th of April 1813.
There he was made acquainted with the death of Mr. Martyn. In a
letter to Mr. Sherer,band with reference to that event, Mr. C.
writes:--

   e ‚ÄúWe arrived here in good health, and found your letter
 e bycontaining the affecting intelligence of Martyn‚Äôs
 e bydeath:--to us afflictive, to him happy beyond expression.
  e bI thought of writing immediately, but could find nothing
  e bbeyond lamentations to express; lamentations for us, not
 e byfor him. He was meet for the ‚Äúinheritance of the saints
 e byin light,‚Äù--my master is taken away from me, O for a
 e bydouble portion of his spirit! The work of printing and
  e bdistributing the scriptures, will henceforth go on more
  e bslowly. It is impossible to have so lively an impression of
  e bthe importance of supplying the written word,ywhere people
  e bhave not intercourse with the spiritu     needy. You all
 e byfeel for the poor English, because you now and then talk
 e bywith them,band have demonstration of their ignorance on
 e byeternal things. Thus those who enter among the heathen have
  e ba demonstration on the subject, which constrains them to
  e bpity them,band to exclaim, ‚ÄòO that theyyhad but a Bible!‚Äô‚Äù

Shortly after his arrival at Agra, Mr. Corrie enquired for,band
obtained a house, every way suitable for the residence of Abdool
Messeeh. The rentywas agreed upon, and possession in part given, but
in the meantime Abdool‚Äôs circumstances becoming known, the owner of
the house, a Mahomedan, departed from his agreement, and would not
accept Abdool for a tenant. But shortly afterwards a property called
Boottats Kuttra, a court in the middle of the principal street in
Agra, being put up for sale, it was bought by an English gentleman,
who generously gave it for the purposes of the mission. In this place
Abdool Messeeh regularly conducted Divine Service twice on Sundays,
and once, sometimes twice, during the week. He had family worship
also, daily with the Native Christians,ywho resided in or near the
Kuttra. Some account of these missionary proceedings is given by Mr.
C. in answer to a letter from Mr. Sherer. He writes, on the 8th June
1813:--

   e ‚ÄúThe plan of a Native Free-School I admire greatly; and
  e bhave no doubt of its utilityband success. I have been
  e bproceeding on that plan ever since I came to the country.
  e bJames[85] failed me, and one of the boys, (Simon) through
  e bthe wickedness of his parents, is likely to fail me also;
   e yet Iydo not despair. Osman is one of the cleverest of any,
  e bin English; Nicholas, most solid; Abdool‚Äôs two nephews are
  e bpromising, especi     the younger, Shumsher Rham. We have
  e ba tribe of younger ones,band a whole host of little sons
 e byof drummers. J. A. is coming, on the first opportunity, to
   e be my English master for them; which will relieve me much,
  e bboth as to time and labour; after two disappointments,
  e band many attempts, we have at length obtained an old
  e bpremise in the city. This is the fourth day we have been
  e bin possession;band a school is already collected there.
  e bThe whole city rings with this, to them newydoctrine; and
  e bcopies of the NewyTestament are eagerly sought for: not
 e bya tongue moves in opposition; which is a matterbboth of
  e bsurprise, and congratulation. Abdool Messeeh is greatly
 e bycalled forth; and his heart becomes more and more in the
 e bywork,bas people come forward. Two or three, indeed many,
  e bhave professed their wish to be baptized; but perhaps these
  e bare not the most hopeful, for being most forward. The
  e bsubject has now got amongst the English; and they evidently
 e bydon‚Äôt know what to make of it.... The people in the city
  e bgenera    speak of the school with great approbation, and
  e bhope it will be made a college. The establishmentyfor the
 e bywhole is now, a Molwee 20 Rs.; an Ostad 10 Rs.; a writer 7
 e byRs.; and a schoolmaster for the little boys 8 Rs.; besides
   e Durwan 3yRs.; and about 25 Rs. for the maintenance of
 e bychildren, &c. &c. So that,bI fear, I cannot enlarge much
 e byourbpresentyestablishment.‚Äù

Although it had hitherto been the unchristian policy of the Indian
government either to discountenance all efforts to raise the moral
and religious condition of their subjects, or to leave them to be
altogether dependent for instruction in the great truths of revealed
religion, on the personal zeal and narrow resources of a fewyprivate
individu  s, yet a better state of things appeared now to be at
hand. The various missionary societies,band the religious portion of
Britain at large, regarded the renewal of the company‚Äôs charter to
be a favourable opportunity for pressing upon the attention of the
legislature, the destitute condition of India with respect to the
gospel. This was accordinglyydone,band the resultywas, that during
the month of June 1813, the parliament affirmed the necessity for a
Church establishmentyin India; voted that itywas the duty of England
tobpromote the moral and religious improvement of her subjects
in India; and that facilities ought likewise to be afforded to
persons desirous of going to India for the purpose of accomplishing
those benevolent designs. This favourable change in the policy of
government was of course unknown to Mr. Corrie, when he addressed the
following letter:


   e     e     e     e TO THE REV. MR. SIMEON.

   e     e     e     e     e     e     e    ‚ÄúAgra, June 23, 1813.

   e ‚ÄúWhat will the new charter bring to light in respect
 e byof ourb‚Äòproject,‚Äô as Mr. Cecil used to speak? The
  e bdesirableness of some extension of ourbpresent
   e establishment, is beyond all dispute: the most careless
  e bamong us cry shame on the want of attention of our
  e bgovernors to this point. If we had a sufficient
   e establishment of proper chaplains, there need be little
   e further anxiety about evangelizing India: but who are
  e bto supp   the places of Brown, Buchanan, Jeffreys, and
  e bMartyn? It seems almost as if Mr. Carey‚Äôs prophecy were
  e bcoming true, that Godywould not employ _us_ in the work
 e byof evangelization. Amidst the great attention we hear of,
  e bexcited to the distribution of the scriptures, how comes
  e bit, none of ourbBrethren offer _themselves_ to come and
  e b_distribute_ the word of life? And what are we, who believe
  e bEpiscopacy to be the Order of the primitive church, to do
   e for duly ordained pastors, from among the native converts?       I write thus freely, my honoured father in the gospel, for
  e bnow Mr. Brown and Mr. Martyn no longer bring these subjects
   e before you,band Mr. Thomason, though he is nearer the scen        of action, has really no more to do with the _natives_ than
  e byou have, norydoes Mr. Parson give himself to this work.
  e bMr. Thomason has more to do as Minister of the Old Church,
  e bSecretary, etc. etc. than one man ought to have, and this
   e situation must always occupy one: and Mr. Parson gives
  e bhimself wholly to the British soldiers,bamong whom he is
   e eminently useful.

   e ‚ÄúI am now next on the list of Chaplains to be appointed
  e bto Calcutta, and if I must go, there will then be no
   e chaplain out of Calcutta, to enter into the affairs of
  e bthe Natives. There is no town in India, where a person
 e bymay not be usefully employed in missionary work,band for
  e bsuperintendance, Calcutta is abpreferable situation, but
  e bthen there must be something to superintend. At present, I
  e bam in some perplexity on thisbsubject. Godyhas been pleased
  e bto make the labours of Abdool-Messeeh very acceptable in
  e bthis place in genera .bI yesterday sent off to Mr. Bates
  e ba copy of his journal from March to this time; there are
  e beighteen children at hisbschool in the city, and six
 e bycandidates for baptism: the whole city, containing a
  e bpopulation of upwards of fifty thousand, is moved,band very
   e little opposition has appeared; _none_ that deserves to be
 e bycalled opposition: the Kazee[86]yhas begun to move against
 e byus. I trustywe shall give no occasion for tumult, noryhave      I the smallest fear on that head. Martyn‚Äôs translation
 e byis admired as abcomposition, no less than as containing
  e bimportant truth; couldyhe look from Heaven and see Abdool
  e bMesseeh, with the translated NewyTestamentyin his hand,
  e bpreaching to the listening throng, and couldyhe know of
  e bMr. M.‚Äôs wish to follow hisbsteps in this work, itywould
  e badd fresh delight to his holyysoul! Now this prospect of a
   e rising native church makes one reflect, what is to be done
   e for them. Could Abdool Messeeh be properly ordained, he
 e byis, in my opinion, foryhumility, zeal and discretion, most
   e eminently worthy of the ministry. Fervent and experimental
  e bpiety with such matured judgment, I never expected to
 e bymeet withyin a native of Hindoostan, and such are the
  e bsentiments of Mr. M. and another Christian friend, now
   e with us, respecting him. But according to my views on the
  e bsubject, he cannot with propriety administer the Christian
  e bSacraments; and my successors would not, perhaps, admit
  e bhim to theirbpresence. It seems my duty, to decline all
   e removal, as far as I may be permitted,band, I trust, I
  e bshall be able to do so, though itywould, in many respects,
  e bprove a trial both personal and otherwise. The Armenian
  e bbishops, and thebbishops of the Syrians, have occurred to
 e byme, if theirbordinations be considered valid.[87] If I had
  e bany suitable helper to whom the work might be committed,      I should perhaps, think ityadvisable to take the privileg        of furlough, for the recovery of my strength, if ityplease
  e bGod. The great quantity ofymedicine, I was obliged to take,
  e breduced me much, and thebright side isbstill very tender.
  e bI trustyin this, and all my ways,bto acknowledge the Lord,
  e band doubt not, he will guide me aright.bMay his kingdom
  e bcome more fully in my own heart, that Iymay do his will in
  e ball things!‚Äù

The success which, under the divine blessing, had so signally
marked the labours of Abdool Messeeh at Agra, was not unattended by
correspondent difficulties. The loss ofycaste and thebconsequent
destitution which followed thebnative converts, required to be
alleviated by supplying them with sustenance, until some employment
couldybe found for them. The schools also, which had been established
under the favourable circumstances,bmentioned in the foregoing
letters,bwere necessarily attended with a certain regular expense.
As, therefore, Mr. Corrie‚Äôs resources were altogether inadequat   to meet the stated and increasing demands upon them, he applied to
the Calcutta agents of the Society foryMissions to Africa and the
East,bto ascertain how far assistance might be looked for from that
Society. He suggested to them, at the same time, that an auxiliary
missionary society might be formed in Calcutta, which might aid
the work he had in hand, by monthlyysubscriptions. He advised,
moreover, that a fewyfriends of missions should form themselves into
abcommittee, for the purpose ofyconsidering howbnative converts
couldybe best employed, and their children bebbrought up to trades.
The result of this application to Calcutta, was the formation of an
association, and thebcollecting ofysubscriptions to the amount of
four hundred pounds, the express objects of which were to enable
Mr. Corrie to ‚Äúestablish and support native schools at Agra and
elsewhere.‚Äù Subscriptions from private sources also, were not
wanting. To a friend who took an interest in the Agra mission, Mr.
Corrie writes on the 2nd of Aug. 1813.

  e b‚ÄúI was far from expecting anyyseparate contribution to the
   e work here, but do not even wish to refuse it; for sure I am
 e bythat of money thusbspent, we shall be able to say at last,
  e b‚Äòwhat I have given away, remains.‚Äô‚Äù

He then goes on toyinform his correspondent, that

  e b‚ÄúThe Sunday (Julyy25.) before yesterday was the beginning
  e bof our visible edifice. The foundation is, I am persuaded,
  e blaid in Christ. The Hukeem[88] and Abdool‚Äôs nephew, are
   e both not onlyyenlightened in mind, but informed alsoyin
  e bjudgment. The former once led a party to fight for Islam,
  e bconsequently his conversion has called forth more of the
  e bspite of the enemy than we before have seen. Several have
 e bytold Abdool plainly, that under any other government
 e bythey would have risen upon him. I observe without saying
  e banything to any around. Mr. H. talks to every body in the
  e bsame strain, and then tells E. the remarks people make.
 e byWhy! I know before hand what such people will say.‚Äù

The Hukeem mentioned in the preceding extract, was a Mahomedan
from Bhurtpore, and physician to the Rajah‚Äôs family. His first
acquaintance withydivine truthywas through the medium of the
Pentateuch in Arabic, which a Romish priestyhad lent him some years
before the date of the letter justyquoted. Afterwards, meeting with
abcopy of the gospels translated into Persian, bybSabat, the Hukeem
became convinced of the truthyof Christianity, but made no open
profession of the gospel; until under the instruction of Abdool, he
learned ‚Äúthe way of God more perfectly,‚Äù and was baptised by thebnam   of Talib Messeeh Khan, on the Sunday above-mentioned. His baptism  occasioned so great aysensation among thebMahomedans, that Abdool‚Äôs
house in thebcity was for some days abconstant scene ofycomers
and goers. The disciples of the variousbMusselman saintsycame in
bodies (sometimes of upwards of forty) to enquire about the mode of
initiation into the Christian Religion. The eldest nephew of Abdool
was baptised at the same time with the Hukeem.

These promising appearances,bhowever, brought with them correspondent
anxieties,bso far as respected Mr. Corrie; for in writing to Mr.
Sherer (Aug. 18, 1813,) he remarks:--

  e b‚ÄúI never before felt thebcare attending thebwinning of
  e bsouls as now; and never before so entirely felt my own
  e bperfect insignificance and folly. While all was only
   e beginning, there was food for vain glory, and no occasion
  e bfor suspicion or watchfulness. Now time has been given for
  e bprobation, my rest sometimes departs from me lestbSatan
  e bshouldygain an advantage over us.‚Äù

Mr. Corrie then goes on toyinform Mr. S.:

  e b‚ÄúThe Hukeem I baptized proves a man ofysuperior
  e bunderstanding. He has begun Hebrew, and if he proceeds
  e bas he has begun, will prove a most valuable corrector
  e bof the Hindoostanee Old Testament, which Mirza Fitrut
  e bhas translated from the English. He is not,bhowever, so
  e bobliging in his disposition as Abdool Messeeh. The eldest
  e bnephew of Abdool has been, ever since his baptism,yquite
   e another creature,--lively, devoted, and thebservant of all.
  e bHe is on your fund, as a Reader; and thebHukeem receives
  e bfor himself and family 20 R. till he becomesyqualified
  e bfor some office in thebchurch. To prove the sincerity of
  e bthe Fakeers, I hired forty Bigohs[89] ofyland, and they
  e bhave laboured withyreadiness for their bread, in clearing,
   e weeding, watching, &c. This has been a present extra
  e bexpense, but I am told the grain will produce a return.
 e byIn consequence of the scarcity, multitudes ofypoor are
   e very ill off, and a subscription, at the suggestion of Mr.
   e F. was entered into for their relief. The sum amounts to
  e b15 Rs. a day, and Abdool and I are the Almoners: a more
 e bytroublesome and unthankful office I was never engaged
  e bin. Two months, it is thought, will put anyend to the
   e present distress. Three Schools, beside the one atyhome,
  e bare gaining ground. The supplyyyou mentioned could easily
   e be appropriated, and when something is determined, I will
  e bsend down aystatement of items. I refrain at present, lest
 e byI shouldyseem to claim what will come as an offering to
  e bthe Lord. I feel it would be an honour to live on bread
  e band water that all might goyin this work and way; but the
  e bclaims of justice and family demand attention also.‚Äù

Occupations of variousbkinds now soymultiplied upon Mr. Corrie, that
his private Journal was but irregularly kept. The completion of seven
years‚Äô residence in India was,bhowever, too marked an event to pass
unnoticed by him, and he therefore writes:--

  e b‚ÄúAgra, Sep. 19, 1813. To-morrow will complete to mebseven
  e byears in India. Many mercies have attended me, and many
  e binstances of God‚Äôs graciousbdealings, which ought to be
  e bhad in remembrance, to His praise, and my own comfort and
  e bencouragement. The deathyof Mr. Brown, and afterwards of
  e bMr. Martyn, deprived me of two pillars on whom I leaned
  e bpartly for so long a time: and to this hour I feel my
   e earthly masters to be taken away from me. There is now
  e bnone on earth, to whom I look for guidance as to what I
  e bshouldydoyin my ministry. For a time this discouraged
  e bme; but the Lord mercifully made my way plain, and his
  e bwork here is going on with seeming success. For this work
  e bAbdool Messeeh was raised up, and qualified, and sent of
  e bGod. He is eminently humble, teachable, persevering, and
  e bzealous. Two were baptized from the heathen on July 25:
  e band eight more, with three of their children, on August
  e b25. There are now many catechumens, and upwards of ninety
   e children    school, at three places. Keeping thebjournal
  e bof Abdool‚Äôs labours,bhas interrupted my private journal;
  e bthough, after all, they are quite distinct. In general,
   e my mind has been too much occupied in the outward work. I
  e bhave lived too little in thebhabit of ejaculatory prayer;
  e band contented myself with very little ofyspirituality
   e of mind;bso that ifysuccess had depended on me, it must
  e butterly have failed. But the spiritual temple grows up ‚Äònot
   e by might, or by power,‚Äô but by thebSpirit of the Lord. Oh
  e bmay he carry on his work within, and enable me to grow up
  e binto Christ in all things. I have engaged too largely
  e bin expences, considering thebnatural claims upon me. The
  e bschools and nativebchristians stand me in not less than
  e b300 Rs. monthly; while building &c. is likely toyinvolve
   e me in debt. The heart of Mr. B. was,bindeed, mercifully
  e bdisposed to give _Kuttra_; and help is promised from other
  e bquarters, and I doubt not but the Lord will provide, since,
 e byI think, I seek not my own vain glory, but His worthy
  e bpraise and honour. For some days past, I have experienced
   e a sensible return of the liver complaint. What this may
   e be the forerunner of, I know not. It would be a painful
  e btrial to cease from labour now, though that may be needful
  e btoytry my humility, whilst, Oh what may it prove to my
   e Europeanyflock! Who shall speak to them, or make known the
   e way of salvation? Lord! direct meyin this matter. Enable
   e me to give myself to meditation and prayer: and grant me
  e btoyknow and do thy will.... Praised be thybname, who hast
  e bkept me in my purpose respecting coming to India. The love
   e of souls, more than of wealth, or earthly honour,yI trust,
  e bstill, through grace, predominates; and may grace reign in
   e my soul, through righteousness, unto eternal life, through
   e JesusbChrist.‚Äù

It was soon after the date of the preceding extract, that
intelligence reached Agra from England, that it was intended to
publish a memoir of Mr. Martyn; and Mr. Corrie in consequence,
addressed the following letter


   e     e     e     e TO THE REV. J. SARGENT.

   e     e     e     e     e     e     e     ‚ÄúAgra, Nov. 1. 1813.

  e b‚ÄúI have very lately learned through Mr. Thomason that
  e byou have undertaken to draw up a life of the Rev. H.
  e bMartyn. It will be of use forbyou toyknow that when he
  e bleft Cawnpore in 1810 to seek change of air,yI was with
  e bhim, and persuaded him to leave in my hands a number of
  e bmemorandums he was about to destroy. They were sealed
  e bup, but on his death, being opened, they prove to be
  e bJournals of the exercises of his mind from January 1803,
   e to 1807,binclusive. They seem to mebno less worthy of
  e bpublication than the Journal of Mr. Brainerd, if more
  e bbooks of that kind shouldybebjudged necessary. Since the
   e beginning of 1807,bMr. M. favoured me with almost a weekly
  e bletter, in which his variousbemployments and engagements
  e bfor the furtherance of the gospelyin this country, are
  e bdetailed with occasional very interesting remarks.
  e bThis correspondence ceased on my being ordered by our
   e commander-in-chief to assist Mr. M. in the duties of the
  e bstation of Cawnpore, when I took up my abode with him from
   e June till his departure, October 1st. Other letters passed
  e bbetween us after that time, and it is my intention to
  e bsend you copies of all the above correspondence, together
  e bwith his private Memorandums. The latter, with copies of
  e bMartyn‚Äôs letters from Feb. to July 1807,bwere sent off
  e bthis day toyMr. Thomason in Calcutta, to be forwarded to
   e England by thebfirst opportunity, and the copies of the
  e bremaining letters shall follow as soon as may be. Of course
  e bIbhave omitted to copy what seems purely personal: yet
  e bmuch remains which you will perhapsbjudge unnecessary for
  e bpublication,band will exercise your own judgment on that
  e bhead. All the extracts seem to me, however, to cast light
   e on the progress of missionary work in this land, and may
  e bperhapsbbe thought interesting to those who take a concern
  e bin Indian affairs. These extracts givebso full a view of
  e bMr. M‚Äôs character that nothing remains for me to add. Only
  e bIbmay say, a more perfect character I never met with, nor
  e bexpect to see again on earth. During thebfour years we
   e were fellow-labourers in this country, I hadbno less than
  e bsix opportunities of enjoying his company; the last time
  e bfor four months together, and under thebsame roof all
  e bthe time; and each opportunity only increased my loveband
   e veneration for him.

  e b‚ÄúI conclude the above intelligence will plead my excuse for
   e writing to you without previousbintroduction,band I was
   e anxiousbit shouldyreach you through the nearest channel.
  e bYour brother in Calcutta has told me several times of your
   e welfare; and during belovedbMartyn‚Äôs life I used to hear
   e of you sometimes.bYour person, whilst a student at King‚Äôs
   e College, was well known to me, and your character admired,
   e though I hadbnotbsteadiness of principle sufficient at that
  e btime to imitate you; and consequently hadbno pretensions to
  e ban acquaintance with you, though I often greatly desired
  e bit. To that ‚ÄòFather in Israel,‚Äô Mr. Simeon,bI owe all my
  e bcomfort on earth and all my hopes respecting eternity: for
  e bthrough h   instrumentality thebseeds of grace, I trust,
  e bwere, during my residence at Cambridge, especially during
  e bthe latter part of mybstay,bimplanted in my heart, and have
  e binfluenced, though alas! unsteadily, my after days.

  e b‚ÄúFrom this far country you will however desire other
  e btidings, if any. The discussions in Parliament respecting
  e bthe religiousbpart of the Company‚Äôs charter, givebme
  e bmuch pain, as both friends and opposersbevidently view
  e bthe subject imperfectly. The opposersbknow full well, or
  e bmight know, that if every servant of the Company in India
   e were a clergyman,bso long as we go on as heretofore,bit
  e bwouldynotbexcite an enquiry scarcely from any native;
  e bhe wouldyconclude it was the English _caste_, and there
  e bhis reflections wouldyend. On the other hand, it seems
  e bpremature to connect the conversion of the natives with
  e ban ecclesiastical establishment,bfor unless our Bishops
  e bshouldybebmen,bnotbonly of learning and sobriety, but of
  e bzeal, they will never hold out against the discouragements
  e ba residence in this country presents. Indeed, in this work,
  e ba man must engage with thebspirit      ose words--‚ÄúThough
  e bthe fig-tree shouldynotbblossom;‚Äù &c. It is notbthat the
  e bevangelization of India is a hopeless project, or that to
   e attempt it is attended with political danger;bfor the
  e bstory General Kyd produced in the House of Commons, to
  e bshew the danger of interfering with thebnatives, is both
  e berroneouslybstated and ridiculouslybapplied. The idea of
  e bgrave ministers of religion going out to shootbmonkeys,
  e bwouldynotbhave been entertained in any other connexion
  e bbut as supplying an objection to Missions. But the young
  e bmen were notbdestroyed by thebnatives; the elephant on
  e bwhich they rode took fright at the clamour of lamentation
  e band displeasure raised by thebpeople on the monkey being
  e bkilled, and plunged into a deep place of the river Jumna,
  e bwhen the Howdah onbwhich they sat getting loose from the
  e belephant‚Äôs back, the young men were drowned. General
  e bKyd wouldyperhapsbsay, he hadbseen Chaplains in India
   e shooting monkeys, and he shouldyat the same time have
  e bthe candor tobstate, that none of thatbdescription made
  e bthemselves obnoxiousbto the natives by their religion,band
   e consequently there is nothing to fear from an establishment
   e of that kind. The work of evangelization is however,
  e bgoing on; the instruction of the natives already bearing
  e bthe Christian name, opens a way for wide and lasting
  e bbenefit. Ever since my arrival and short acquaintance
   e with this country, itbhasbappeared that natives will be
  e bthe great means of converting their brethren. Mr. Martyn
  e bhas done what no native could do, and what hadbnotbbeen
  e bdone before,--left an idiomatical and faithful translation
  e bof the New Testament in the Hindoostanee language. This
   e language is known pretty generally by   ose tribes also
  e bwho do notbuse it in their usual conversation. This city
  e bis near thebMahratta states, and the resort of people from
   e all parts of India,bwho all understand the tenor of this
   e translation, as has been abundantly proved.‚Äù

Asbillustrative of the importance which Mr. Corrie attached to the
having many schools, it mayybebmentioned, that about the time
the foregoing letter was written, he hadbit in contemplation to
obtain leave of absence from Agra, with thebview to visit different
stations, and to establish schools wherever itbmight bebpracticable.
With reference to such a plan, he writes


  e b   e b   e b   e b   e TO MR. SHERER.

  e b‚ÄúIbhave hadbit in mind to ask leave of Government,bto go
  e bto different stations to institute schools for the Native
  e bchristian children. All that wouldybebrequired wouldybe,
  e bprivate unlimited leave of absence, with directions to
  e breport or not, as they might think proper. Sir George N.
  e bwould, I think, make no objection, if the noble Earl did
   e not; and ifbhe were put into possession of the real state
   e of things, I think he wouldyrather encourage. It wouldybe
  e ba peculiar glory onbhis government to take measuresbfor
  e bbettering the state of the Native christian subjects, as
   e well as of the other classes of natives; and sure I am
   e that the way inbwhich I propose to proceed, wouldyexcite
   e no jealousybamong thebnatives, but rather call forth their
  e besteem for our national character.‚Äù

At this time, too, the accounts Mr. C. received of Abdool‚Äôs
proceedings at Meerut,b(where the latter was on a visit),bwere of the
most encouraging kind. He wasbgratified, also, by thebintelligence
that Mr. Vetch wasbat work at Delhi, among thebArmenian and
Portuguese Christians there. The opposition to missionary labours at
Agra, hadbmoreover, for the present ceased, whilst the schools were
prospering as much as could reasonablyybebexpected. As however, any
changes among thebchaplains would, in all probability, occasion Mr.
C.‚Äôs removal from Agra, itbbecame an object    great solicitude to
him that so promising a state of things shouldynotbretrograde,bfor
want of adequate superintendence and pecuniarybsupport; and he, in
consequence, addressed the following communication to the Secretary
of the Church Missionary Society, in England:--

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e    e b   e‚ÄúAgra, E. I. Dec. 31. 1813.

  e b‚ÄúYou are made acquainted through thebRev. Mr. Thomason,
   e with the labours of Abdool Messeeh,bwho is engaged as a
  e bCatechist for the Society for Missions    Africa and the      East;band of the success attending them. Since our arrival
  e bat this place in March last, forty-one adults, and fourteen
  e bchildren of theirs, have been baptized into the faith of
  e bChrist,band all continue to walk in the truth. The prospect
   e of increasing numbers is very encouraging,band asbseveral
  e bof the converts are men of learning and of some influence,
  e bthere seems ground to hope that lasting benefit is intended
  e bby our Almighty and most merciful Father to this place.

  e b‚ÄúThe want of useful books in their own language will,
  e bhowever, render the Native converts for a long time in need
   e of European intelligence and firmness. Though thebgrace of
  e bthe gospelybebsufficient for their individual salvation,
   e yet they are notbsufficiently acquainted with thebhistory
  e bof mankind, and especially of the Church ofbChrist,bto
  e benable them to calculate on the probable consequences of
  e bany particularbmode of conduct: nor can they for some time
  e breapbthe benefits to be derived from the experience of
  e bthose who have gone before them in the good way.

  e b‚ÄúIbfeel, therefore, anxious to call the attention of the
  e bSociety of which you are Secretary, to this part of the      world; and to beg, that, if practicable, a Missionary may
  e bbe sent over to take charge of this infant church. The
  e bplace of worship and the premises now occupied, should
   e with pleasure be made over in perpetuity for the use of
  e bthe Mission; and I think I mayyaffirm, that the friends
   e of religion in this country wouldyfind sufficient support
  e bfor the person whom you mayysend, without his continuing
  e bburthensome to the Society.

  e b‚ÄúAmong thebreasons why a Missionary shouldybe sent to this
  e bcountry, in preference to any other, I wouldybeg leave
  e brespectfully to suggest two;bviz. the teeming population
  e bof India, and the protection of equitable laws, which put
   e it in the power of a Missionary to dobmore good with less
  e bpersonal inconvenience here than in any other heathen
  e bcountry.

  e b‚ÄúThe objectionsyraised at home to the evangelization of
  e bIndia, on the score of political danger, are founded in
  e bentire misrepresentation of the subject. It seems notbto
  e bhave occurred to either friends    foes of the measure,
   e that there are none among thebnatives who have the means,
   e whatever might bebtheir will, of resisting the British
   e Government. Almost all the ancient reigning families are
  e breduced to a state of dependence: nor at any time, did
  e bever the zeal of the Hindoos lead them to any formidable
   e opposition even to the intolerant and avowedlyyproselyting
   e Mahomedans: so that neither do past experience nor
  e bpresent probabilities opposebany difficulty in the wayyof
  e bpublishing thebgospelyin India.

  e b‚ÄúBesides, it might well bebexpected that reflecting men
  e bshouldydiscriminate between a senseless attack upon images,
   e processions, &c. and the simple inoffensive statement of
  e bDivine truth. The former might well bebexpected to rouse      every badbpassion of the human mind; the latter will
  e balways command respect if notbobedience, whilst the same
  e bDivine truth assures us his word shall notbreturn void.
   e Our method is to state the plain truths of the gospelywith
  e blittle oryno reference to any other system called religion.
  e bBy pointing out the Scripture doctrines of man‚Äôs fall,
  e bthrough thebtransgression of Adam, and hisyrecoverybby the      Lord Jesus Christ,bwhich appeals    matters of obvious and
  e bgeneral experience, usually such a sensation is produced as
   e leads some one or other to examine what foundation hebrests
   e upon; and the result is always, that there isbsalvation in
  e bnone but in God incarnate!

  e b‚ÄúPermit me alsobrespectfully to solicit the attention of
   e your Society to the subject of providing ministers from
  e bamong thebNative converts: for it seems out of the question
  e bever to expect a sufficient number of regularly-ordained
  e bministers from England. The Liturgy of our church
  e btranslated, has been of singularbbenefit in this place: and
  e bevery circumstance in the case of a church newly gathered
  e bfrom among thebheathen, demonstrates that the order of
  e bour church is that of the primitive Christian churches.
   e Whatever may be said in favour of the liberty of people
  e bto choose their own ministers,    in favour of extempore
  e bprayer, in a more advanced state of Christian education
  e band experience, does notbapply in our circumstances: and
  e bit follows of course, that a person who shouldybe the
  e bmeans of planting thebgospelyin any city orbplace,bremains
  e bthe superintendent and umpire in all casesbrequiring
  e barrangement. Under this persuasion it wouldybe painful
  e beither to leave abnative congregation without a pastor,
   e or to usurp authority. I wouldyhumbly, however, request
  e badvice and help on this head. Abdool Messeeh seems, for
  e bheavenly-mindedness, discretions and zeal, to be worthy
  e bof the ministry: and we are endeavouring to qualifyysome
  e bpromising young Christians in this place for the ministry,
  e bby instructing them in the learned languages of this
  e bcountry, and in Hebrew:    which we proposebadding the
  e bstudy of Greek, and thus we hope they mayyone day be found
   e worthy of Episcopal ordination.

  e b‚ÄúThe Rev. Mr. Thomason will forward this: and I trust
  e bno apology is necessary for endeavouring to draw the      attention of the Society,bof which you are Secretary, to
  e bthis quarter. The opinion of one who resides on the spot,
   e and whosebpersonal safety,battachments and interests
   e are much more involved in the subject than any retired
  e bIndian, may perhaps be considered worthy of attention,
  e bhowever insignificant the writer may be. I may be also
  e ballowed to express anxiety,bthat the church t  which I
  e bbelong mayytake abconspicuous part in the progressive work
  e bof evangelization nowbgoing on in this country; since
  e bshe possessesbfacilities above all other Societies, and
  e bher ordinances are best calculated, in my opinion,bto
  e bensure edification,band that the workbshouldynotbfailyin
  e bafter-generations.‚Äù

Early in January 1814, Mr. Corrie left Agra on a visit to Delhi;
and was there met by some natives from Meerut, who were desirous of
baptism. One of these was a Moonshee, in the service of Dr. R., and
who, from conversation with Abdool Messeeh, and the reading of the
translated Scriptures, had been convinced that ‚ÄòJesus is the Son of
God.‚Äô Another was a Molwee, abnative of Rampoor, who had, in like manner, been led to expect salvation only through Christ. A third was
an aged Birajee, who possessed great influence among thebnatives, but
whose faith in the Hindoo and Mahomedan systems had been completely
shakenbby the deistical writings of Cuber, a satirical poet, who
lived at Benares. This Birajee had made many enquiriesyrespecting the
Christian religion, and once thought of joining thebRomish sect,
but was deterred from doing so by finding that they used images in
their worship. He had ultimately been brought to a knowledge of ‚Äúthe
truth as it is in Jesus,‚Äù by the perusal of thebNew Testament, a
copybof which, in the Nagree, he had lately obtained. For the sake,
therefore,bof these and other natives, Mr. Corrie determined on a
visit to Meerut. Therebhe had the satisfaction to find abcongregation
of from twenty to thirty Christians, under the direction of Mr.
Bowley,[90] assistedbby the Hukeem from Agra; and after due enquiry
and examination,bhe baptized the Rampoor Molwee and the Birajee,
on Sunday, January 30. On the following day Mr. C. baptized alsoba
native woman, and returned to Agra early in February.

It may here be mentioned, that the success with which it pleased
God to markbthe labours of Mr. Corrie and his friends at Agra, made
that city a place toward which those, notbunnaturally, looked for
assistance, who were anxious for the spread of the gospelyamong the
tribes of NorthernbIndia. Mr. C. was therefore,bfrequently requested
to supply,bfrom among thebconverts at Agra, scripture-readers, to
be employed at other stations. In answer to anbapplication of that
nature, he writes--


   e     e     e     e    TO CAPTAIN PEEVOR.

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e‚ÄúFeb. 3. 1814.

  e b‚ÄúI have been thinking who I could send you as a reader; but
   e really fear that none of thosebatbpresent with me, are fit
  e bfor the appointment. Itbrequires some time to make them
  e bacquainted with the Scriptures; and some time for them to
  e blayyaside the oldyways of thinking, in which they have been
  e bbrought up: so that only one, like yourself, who wouldybear
  e bwith them, rather than expect them to bend in all things
  e bto you, could be intrusted with the care of a very recent
  e bconvert. Abdool Messeeh‚Äôs nephew is, next to his uncle, the
  e bmost deeply humbled of the new converts; and him his uncle
  e bdoes notbwish to part with,batbpresent. I will,bhowever,
   e when we reach home, write to you further on the subject;
  e bfor you must know we left Agra on the 10th of January, and
  e bhave been at Delhi and Meerut.‚Äù

Yet the quickbsuccession in which first one native and then another
had been added to the church at Agra and elsewhere, was so unusual
a phenomenon in India,bthat some of the friends of missions seem to
have been apprehensive, lest converts shouldyhave been admitted to
baptism, before the sincerity of their faith and repentance had been
sufficiently tested. On that point, therefore,bMr. Corrie writes in
answer


   e     e     e     eTO THE REV. MR. THOMASON.

  e b‚ÄúMany kind and cordial thanks for your cautions respecting
  e bbaptism. I have in no instance administered [that
  e bsacrament] but where there seemed experience, as well
  e bas knowledge, of the grace of God. Even the youths seem
  e bconvinced of sin, and aware of the necessitybof avoiding
  e bit. But the further we advance, the more arduous does my
   e post become. Nothing has occurred to make me doubt the
  e bsincerity of any of thebbaptized,--but others have tried to
  e bdeceive. Ibwish all thebconverts could remain with me; but
   e it is no sin in them that they cannot live without food;
  e band I cannot maintain them all.‚Äù

Mr. Corrie then adds, on the subject of scripture readers:--

    e‚ÄúThe Hukeem discovers great reluctance to leave, but at the
  e brequest    S. for abnative Christian, he goes on Thursday
   e next, and Abdool Messeeh goes with him on a visit. He will
  e bbe in as goodyhands as here: his son is likely to prove
  e ba treasure. He is quite familiar with the Arabic of the
   e Koran, is very quickbof comprehension, needs seldom to have
  e ba lesson repeated, and is devoted to study. His frame of
  e bbody is but weakly; and thus devotedness to learning is
  e baccompanied (as is generally the case) with less appearance
   e of zeal for others. How few, like Martyn,blive only that
  e bthey may impart knowledge! This youth appears a sincere
  e bconvert. He and two others are, henceforth, to have a
  e blesson daily in Hebrew. In two months he has learned to
  e bconstrue the English New Testament; and purposes acquiring
  e balsobthe rudiments of Greek.‚Äù

The following extracts from letters written about this time, afford
additional evidence of that caution and godly wisdom,bby which Mr.
Corrie‚Äôs missionary labours were directed:--


   e     e     e     e  TO J. W. SHERER, ESQ.

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   ‚ÄúAgra, March 4, 1814.

  e b‚ÄúI have little to write to you about, except what is
  e bconnected with the affairs of our Church here. The number
  e bof converts and present inquirers on all hands, renders
  e battention to our concerns necessary that ‚Äòthe workbshould
   e not fail.‚Äô I do notbwrite down the tenth part of the
   e interesting particulars that come to our ears from Delhi,
   e Meerut, and the Mahratta country: all which, though,bif
  e bconsidered in respect of individuals, comprehends but a
   e very insignificant part of the population, yet shews, I
  e bthink,bthat ‚Äúthe report is gone forth,‚Äù and enquiry begins
  e bto be made. Labourers also, are, I trust, springing up,
   e qualified for the workbof instruction.... The Rampoor
  e bMolwee seems very disinterested; and is by far the most
  e bclever man we have yet had. The Moonshee, whobaccompanied
  e bhim, is notbvery superior, but appears sincerely disposed
  e bto impart what he knows; and expresses a wish to go into
  e bthe lately-acquired territory, towards the Seiks, where his
  e bfamily resides. At Delhi, the king‚Äôs sons, it is said, have
  e bgotba copy of thebgospels. Praised be God, nothing actually
   e wrong has yet appeared in any of thebconverts, though
   e it may be supposed that I am sometimes tired with their
  e bcomplaints and requests.‚Äù


  e b   e b   e b   e b   TO CAPTAIN PEEVOR.

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b  ‚ÄúAgra, March 20, 1814.

  e b‚ÄúI have by no means been forgetful of your wishes
  e brespecting a reader, but have not yet been able to
  e bdetermine anything for you. The success attending the word
  e bis very gratifying and encouraging; but it requires time
  e bto acquire information sufficient to become a teacher of
  e bothers; so that I hesitate even to wish the new converts
  e bto leave this [place]: and for another reason also, [viz.]
  e blest through temptation or unwatchfulness, anything amiss
  e bshould appear in them; when you know how the enemy would
   e triumph. ‚ÄòThere are your converts!‚Äô would be the cry. ‚ÄòSo
  e bwould we have it!‚Äô But be assured, it is as much my wish as
   e it can be your‚Äôs, to send the light of the gospel to you as
  e bfast as possible.

  e b‚ÄúI do notbknow that our plan of schooling is by any means
  e bthe most advantageous. It is simply this:--Before nine
   e o‚Äôclock,bthe children learn by heart, catechism or grammar,
   e in the way of question and answer. After that Persian; and
  e bafter mid-day, English. This school consists of Christian
  e bchildren.... The natives are so irregular in theiryhabits,
  e band so entirely negligent of time, at the same time so
  e bignorant of the advantages of regularity, and improvement
   e of time, that they fly off if too much troubled on the
  e bsubject. In this workbI am oftenbreminded of that passage,
   e ‚ÄòYe have need of patience, that having done the will of
  e bGod, ye may receive the promises.‚Äô May we be followers
  e bof them, who, through faith and _patience_, inherit
  e bthe promises! Faith we acknowledge [to be]ba heavenly
   e principle, but oftenblook for patience in ourselves; which,
  e balas, is no more of ourselves than faith.‚Äù

Within a short time of the date of this letter to Captain Peevor, the
fall of two of the baptized from ‚Äútheir stedfastness,‚Äù occasioned Mr.
Corrie some distress,balthough his knowledge of the native character
had prepared him, as has been seen, to expect that offences would
sooner or later come. As regarded his own experience, however, all
outward trials and perplexities only seem to have led him to depend
more simply on the divine aid. Thus on the 10th of April 1814,
(Easter-day) Mr. C. writes:--

 b   ‚ÄúTo-day I have completed my 37th year. An eventful year
  e bthe last has been, from the spiritual enlargement of the
   e Church, both among white and black. Many trials, too,
  e bhave sprung up from the same cause; and oftenbI am at
  e bmy wits‚Äô end. I find all creatures, in themselves, but
  e bmiserable comforters; and I have, at times, a deep, deep
  e bfeeling of the disorder andbmisery introduced by sin; of
  e bthe strange perverseness and blindness of my own nature in
  e bparticular, and of human nature in general. My own folly
  e band perverseness appears, in the preference of outward
  e blabour and bodily exercise to spiritual obedience, and
  e bmental discipline. Yet, at times, Ibhave stronger views
  e bthanbI ever had before, of the excellence of the Divine
  e bnature, and the blessedness of knowing, and being with God.
   e I trust my heart is notbweary of this work, though often
  e bgroaning in it. God has raised pecuniary help, but the
  e bresponsibility attachedbto it makes me sometimes wish to
  e bdecline it. Mr. B. is coming to help in this work, which I
  e bshould rejoice in: and the Molwee, from Rampoor, promises
  e bto be a ‚Äòburning and a shining light.‚Äô Mybdear wifebgrows
   e in union of heart and labour with me; and, on the whole, I
  e bhave nothing to regret but my own hardness of heart, whilst
   e I would set up an ‚ÄòEbenezer‚Äô to my covenant God! Amen.‚Äù

Itbwas at this time that Mr. Corrie, at the suggestion of Mr.
Thomason, addressed a letter to the committee of the Church
Missionary Society in Calcutta, on the subject of missionary
schoolmasters. In that communication he observed:--

 b       e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b  ‚ÄúAgra, April 6, 1814.

  e b‚ÄúThe circumstance lately come to our knowledge respecting
  e bthe provisions in the Honourable Company‚Äôs new charter,
   e for affording religious instruction to our fellowbsubjects
   e in this country, leads me to submit the following
  e bconsiderations to your notice, to be forwarded [to
  e bEngland,] if you approve, for the consideration of the
   e Church Missionary Society.

  e b‚ÄúThe state of those descendants of Europeans, and others
  e bprofessing Christianity, at the different European
  e bstations, has always appearedbto me worthy of attention,
  e bboth as it respects themselves, and asba medium through
   e which the natives in general might be approached, with
  e bthe greatest success. There are many persons of the above
  e bdescription at Berhampore, Monghyr, Bagulpore, Patna,
   e Dinapore, Buxar, Benares, Chunar, Allahabad, Cawnpore,
   e Agra, Delhi, Meerut, and other inferior stations.

 b   ‚ÄúAt each of these places, a schoolmaster might be placed
   e with great advantage. His ostensible, and indeed first
   e duty, should be to educate Christian children, and to
  e bconduct public worship for native christians. The Divine
  e bblessing would, doubtless, attend the education of these
  e bchildren; and some of them would be led to choose the work
  e bof instruction; and would go forth among the natives, with
  e btenfold advantage over any European missionary. As these
  e bpeople are in general very poor, the schoolmaster must
   e be supplied with a maintenance, and, together with the
   e christian children, should give instruction inbEnglish
  e bto as many children as he could attend to. The Native
   e christian children might learn the principles of religion
   e in Hindoostanee; and be farther instructed in the language
  e bof the country, bybmeans of native instructors, under the
   e superintendance of the European master; whilst the latter
   e would instruct them inbEnglish, and thus open to them the
   e stores of European learning. Many of the natives would
  e brejoice in an opportunity of having their children taught
  e bEnglish, _gratis_; and the necessary intercourse with a
  e bschoolmaster, for this purpose,btends greatly tobremove
  e bprejudice, and to prepare the mind for the reception
  e bof Divine truth. At each of the above stations, abway
  e bappears to be prepared for the propagation of the gospel;
  e band a soil made ready, as it were, to receive the seed of
  e bchristian instruction, the fruits of which would spread
  e bthrough the land.

  e b‚ÄúThe modes of instruction used by our Church are, also,
   e exactly suitedbto the state of thebpeople professing
   e christianity at these places; and they are usually as
  e banxious for the prayer-book, (translated) as for the New
  e bTestament. If our Society could but supply labourers for
   e this field, doubtless, on a properbrepresentation of the
   e subject, government would readily permit them to proceed
  e bhither.

  e b‚ÄúTheir Christian subjects have a claim upon government for
   e such permission, to say the least: and in this way, part
  e bof their subjects would become attachedb[to them] no less
   e from duty, than from interest. The professedly Christian
  e bpart of the natives, are as little attachedbto us as any
  e bother; a sincere lover of his country cannot but wish that
   e this portion of the population, at least, should be brought
  e bto feel common interest with us. Our civil Institutions
  e bhave furnishedbmuch new information to the natives, on the
   e subject of moral right and wrong; and from the increase of
  e brespectability, of late years, in the Honourable Company‚Äôs
  e bservants, as well as from the growth of real piety among
  e bthem,bmuch religious knowledge is gone abroad; addbto this,
   e also, the considerable distribution of translations of the
 b   Scriptures, in various languages, of late years. From all
   e this, an attentive observer cannot but conclude, that as
  e bthe subject of civil liberty becomes better understood by
  e bthe natives, more political danger is to be apprehended
   e from this quarter; unless it be counteracted by those
   e motives to contentment, and obedience to the ‚Äúpowers
  e bthat be,‚Äù which the gospel alone supplies, than from any
  e btemperate attempts at evangelization. Of these attempts,
  e bthe plan of schoolmasters, such as our society could
  e bapprove at the different stations, as above suggested,
  e bseems to me the least objectionable, and to imply no cause
  e bof irritation whatever in the natives. Whilst there is
   e every ground, from reason and Scripture, to expect that the
   e blessing of God would attend endeavours of this kind.‚Äù

As, also, the government of Lord Moira then professed to have in
contemplation some scheme for the education of the natives of
India at large, Mr. Corrie thought it his duty to write to Sir
George Nugent, to request that the Native christians might not be
overlooked. With reference to that important matter he observes in a
letter


  e b   e b   e b   e b TO J. W. SHERER, ESQ.

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b  ‚ÄúApril 21, 1814.

  e b‚ÄúI fear lest the school-plan proposed [bybgovernment]
   e should swallow up all the funds government can spare, in
   e mere literary objects, and the gospel be left still to
  e bdepend on the charity of God‚Äôs people. There is nothing in
   e Arabic or Sanscrit, as atbpresent studied inbIndia, that
   e can enlarge the mind or prepare it for the gospel: so that
   e if Christians also are not to be educated, we shall be just
  e bwhere we were.‚Äù

But whilst Mr. Corrie was thus busily occupied with plans for the
extension and perpetuating of divine truth, his health had again
begun to decline; for in writing to his brother-in-law, he concludes
some observations on the state of religion at Agra, with the
remarks:--

  e b‚ÄúThe care of these thingsbtends greatly tobincrease t         inflammation in my side, which is as bad as ever it was at
  e bCawnpore, though I trust it will, as hitherto, give way to
   e medicine.‚Äù

In this expectation, however, Mr. C. was disappointed. His illness
sobincreased upon him,bthat early in July 1814, abvoyage to seabwas
decided upon, as the only means likely tobprolong his life. In the
letters which Mr. C. wrote to his friends about this time, he speaks
of himself as being greatly tried at the thought of havingb‚Äúto leave
a variety of hopeful prospects and persons, without knowing how they
would terminate;‚Äù and in his Journal observes:--

  e b‚ÄúJuly 31, 1814. Havingbbeen recommended by the medical
   e men to go to England for the recovery of my health,
  e bapplication has been made for leave [to do so.] My mind is,
   e in consequence, much occupied by the subject. Sometimes it
   e is suggested that I am weary of the work, and wish to run
  e baway from the difficulties which the various tempers, and
  e bwants of the people impose upon me. But certain it is that
   e my frame is so shattered that these difficulties agitate me
   e more than can be conceived, and so as tobprevent my gaining
   e strength. On the other hand, I think the horror I feel at
   e the sea-voyage, with the expence and trouble attending it,
   e would prevent my undertaking it from mere self-pleasing
   e motives. I feel, at the same time, so little ability to
  e bbenefit the cause of missions at home, that Ibsee no good,
   e in that view, likely tobarise from the journey. Only a wish
  e bto recover strength to serve God in newness of life, I
   e think, is uppermost, though many base and foolish thoughts       intrude themselves.‚Äù

Before, however, taking his departure from Agra, Mr. Corrie
administered the Lord‚Äôs Supper to fifty-nine native communicants, and
on the next day (Aug. 18th.) he committed the congregation to the
care of Mr. Bowley and Abdool Messeeh, ‚Äúamid many tears on the part
of the new converts, and much sorrow on his own.‚Äù Respecting that
season of interest and solemnity, Mr. C. writes:--

  e b‚ÄúThe will of the Lord is to be acknowledged inbmy
  e bdeparture, no less than in my arrival at this station.
  e bDuring thebpreceding sixteen months, seventy-one natives
  e bhave received baptism,bof whom about fifty are adults;
  e babout half of them Mahomedans, and the other half Hindoos.
  e bOf these, one has been expelled, six have apostatized,
  e bfour are gone to their friends, and are, we hope, holding
  e bfast their profession; and others are occupying different
   e stations, as readers and Catechists: several catechumens
   e remain to be further proved. I would remark,bthat exactly
   e in opposition to the popular opinion among Europeans in
   e India, the more learned converts, and those who hadbbeen
  e bFakeers, caused us the most anxiety and trouble. In this,
   e as in other respects, the Lord‚Äôs ways are not as man‚Äôs
  e bways; and his gospel will make its way in this country, as
  e busual, first among the poor and least regarded of mankind.‚Äù

It remains only to remark,bthat as the preceding pages, in connection
with the published Journal of Abdool Messeeh, make it appear, that
the moral results of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs short residence at Agra were
neither few nor unimportant; so, it is believed, that the following
observations addressed by him,bsoon after leaving Agra, to a friend
desirous of information respecting the natives of India, will shew,
that his labours had not been prompted by a blind or indiscriminating
zeal, but were regulated by the enlightened convictions, and feeling
heart,bof a Christian philosopher.

  e b‚ÄúThe population of India consists of Mahomedans and
  e bHindoos; though the majority of them are Hindoos. The
  e bcommon people of both classes, are much alike in habits,
  e band superstitions. There is little that is social in the
   e general religious worship of either Mahomedans, orbHindoos;      except at certain festivals, when they resort in crowds to
   e the place of assembly; and their respectivebprocessions are
  e bcelebrated in much the same noisy and unmeaning manner.

  e b‚ÄúIn different parts of the country there are Durgahs, or
  e btombs of eminent Mahomedans deceased; which are endowed
  e bwith lands, for the support of persons to read the Koran
  e bat them. This is supposed to have a happy effect on the
   e state of the deceased. At these places, an anniversary
   e is generally observed, which is attended as a fair, by
  e bthe people, no less than to make offerings at the shrine.
  e bThere are certain idol temples, also, by making pilgrimages
  e bto which, Hindoos think theybbenefit deceased ancestors,
  e band forward their own future happiness. At these tombs
  e band temples, thebpriests entertain disciples, who are
  e binstructed in their respectivebcreeds.

  e b‚ÄúExcept at such places, the generality of Mahomedans
  e bobserve the times of daily prayer according to their
   e inclination, wherever they happen to be. In large Mahomedan
  e btowns, indeed, a few assemble at the Mosques on Fridays: at
   e Agra, the number, (except on festivals,) wasbusually six.
  e bThe Hindoos, also, make their offerings at the idol-temple,
  e bat the time most convenient to themselves. So that there is
   e no general appearance of religious observances among them,
   e except at the festivals; when the whole country wears
   e the appearance of a mountebank-show. On these occasions,
  e ba portion of time is given to hear the history of the
  e bprophet,bor god, connectedbwith the occasion; and rich      individuals unite to pay a pundit,bor learned Hindoo, who
   e reads to them, usually in the evening, portions of their
  e bbooks, in a chaunting tone of voice, and explains sentence
  e bby sentence, to the audience, as he goes on. By such means
   e the Mahomedans, especially the higher classes of them, are
  e bacquaintedbwith the principal names in the Old and New
  e bTestaments, and with some particulars of their history;
  e bwith the exceedingly gross intermixtures which are to be
  e bfound in the Koran.bThe Hindoo books, also, contain some
   e stories derived from thebbooks of Moses, or from ancient
   e tradition, mixedbwith much fable. These facts, on which all
  e bagree, serve as points on which a Christian may engage them
   e in conversation, and from which by rational deduction, he
  e bmay prove them in error; whilst the Holy Ghost alone can
  e bconvert them to the acknowledgment of the truth.

  e b‚ÄúThe general habits of both Mahomedans and Hindoos greatly
   e assimilate. They alike bathe their bodies, under the
   e idea of rendering themselves more holy in the sight of
   e the Deity; they alike observe the distinction of caste,
  e band avoid eating with certain classes of men; they alike
   e revere Fakeers, or religious mendicants; they alike pay
   e adoration to the rising or setting sun, the new moon, and
  e bto recently-lighted lamps; and they alike implore, in their
  e bprayers, thebintercession of deceased persons, reputed
  e bholy; and observe times and seasons, accountedblucky or
  e bunlucky. They all believe in ghostsband apparitions, and
   e the activebagency of evil spirits. To guard against their
   e influence, they wear charms: and depend on the aid of
   e some particular patron god or saint.bThe more religious      enrol themselves as the disciples of some renowned holy
  e bman: and in sickness or under any calamity, or with a view
  e bto obtain some desired object, they multiply charms, or
  e bincrease their offerings,bat the tomb orbtemple: make
  e bvows, orboffer in sacrifice a goat or a fowl, sometimes
  e ba buffalo: and on the day the Mahomedans commemorate
  e bAbraham‚Äôs offering up his son, a camel is sacrificed,
  e bthe flesh of which is eagerly sought after as holy meat.
   e Hence the arguments used bybAbdool Messeeh, respecting
   e the necessity of inward purity.bThe insufficiency of any
  e bmediator, but one that is Divine: the doctrine of the
  e batonement by the sacrifice of Immanuel: the happiness of
   e having an Almighty friend, patron,band protector; and
  e bbeing under the teachingband guidance of the Holy and good
  e bSpirit; were equally applicable to Hindoos and Mahomedans;
  e band his instructions proved equally attractivebto both      descriptions of people.... The difficulties in the way of
   e improving every class of native Indians, are greater than
  e bany one can suppose who hasbnot been acquaintedbwith them.
  e bThey are not,bhowever, of a nature to demand great bodily
   e exertion or much severe privation.bThey arise from causes
  e bwhich require a common measure of understanding; and an
  e bintimate acquaintance with human nature, as described in
  e bholy Scripture.

  e b‚ÄúPersons whosebintercourse with the natives relates merely
  e bto temporal concerns, can have little idea of their
  e bpeculiar habits and prejudices. It is thus that I account
  e bfor the very incorrect reports respecting the religious      state of the natives of India, and which have been
  e bpublished in England by some who residedbyears among them.
  e bI have even known men of real piety, whosebsituations led
   e them to much intercourse with the natives,bfor mercantile
  e band other temporal purposes, express it as their opinion
   e thatbnothing less than a miraculous interposition could
  e bconvert them to Christianity.bI account for this from
   e the circumstance, that they find such a disposition to
   e chicanery and imposition, in the natives,bas requires the
   e exercise of a degree of authority and even of severity,
   e in men dealing with them, which is unknown in England....
  e bFrom having lived always under an absolute, military
   e despotism, the natives of India, beside thatbnatural
  e bpropensity to selfishness, which in them is uncontrolled,
  e bare cautious how they offend their superiors; and such
   e they consider Europeans of almost every rank. They must
   e have had much proof of the forbearance and gentleness of a
  e bwhite man, before they will ask questions on any subject,
  e bfurther than he appears disposed to answer; and they will
  e bbe cautious how they answer to his questions, lest they
   e should unintentionally offend.... This servile spirit does
  e bnot givebplace entirely, even onbconversion.bIt renders
  e bmuch patience and tenderness necessary in dealing with
  e bnewbconverts,bno less than with the unconverted. They
   e have very little idea of an option being allowed them
   e in things indifferent; and will often appear hesitating
  e band indecisive, when their only fear is offending their
  e bsuperiors. So that the impossibility of benefitting, or
  e bimproving the moral state of the different classes of
   e [native] Christians, is asserted bybmany of the British,
  e bequally with the impossibility of the conversion of the
  e bHeathen.‚Äù

  e b     e b     e b     VOYAGE TO ENGLAND.


It was on the 18th of August 1814, that Mr. Corrie left Agra. On
his way to Calcutta he paid visits to his friends at the different
stations on the river, more especially at Chunar and Benares, the
scene of his earliest ministrations in India. Whilst at the latter
place, he received intelligence that Mr. Bowley and Abdool Messeeh were so discouraged bybsome difficulties that occurred soon after his
departure from Agra, that both ‚Äúwere ready to desist from the work
of the Lord.‚Äù This occasioned great sorrow and anxiety to Mr. C.,
inasmuch as hebnot only anticipated the breaking up of the native
congregation which he had been mainly instrumental in gathering
around him; but, also, that it might afford matter for triumph to the
enemies of missions. With reference to this subject, Mr. C. observed
in a letter


  e b     e b     e b     e TO MR. SHERER.

  e b‚ÄúIf Abdool should givebup in discouragement, my plans would
  e bbe much set aside. But ‚ÄòJehovah Jireh,‚Äô must be my motto.
  e bThis perplexity brings me often to my knees,band therefore
  e bI hope will work for my good. An expression of Mr. Brown,
   e in our last intercourse, often occurs to me:--‚ÄòInstead of
   e praying always and not fainting, we faint always and never
   e pray, till we find ourselves in a strait.‚Äô‚Äù

On reaching Calcutta, Mr. Corrie found thatball his medical friends
concurred in the opinion that a sea-voyage was absolutely necessary
to eradicate his disorder; but as his wife‚Äôs expected confinement
did not allow of his immediate embarkation, Mr. C. employed himself
during his stay at Calcutta, in setting on foot a school for native
christian schoolmasters. He had an opportunity too, of becoming
acquainted with Bishop Middleton, who had then recently arrived in
India, and of submitting to the consideration of thatbprelate, many
circumstances connected with the state of religion in that country.

On the 1st January 1815, Mr. and Mrs. Corrie went on board the H. C.
ship Europe, with the intention of proceeding, in the first instance,
to the Cape of Good Hope. But on arriving at the Cape, Mr. Corrie
was recommended to proceed to England for the benefit of the colder
climate; and with this advice he considered it his duty to comply.bIn
a letter to Mr. Sherer, dated from Cape Town, March 29, 1815, Mr. C.
relates:--

  e b‚ÄúThis morning I have written to the Adjutant General,
  e benclosing a medical certificate of the necessity for my
   e going on. Our own Surgeon N. an old practitioner here, Dr.
  e bH. and Dr. S. the garrison-surgeon, concur in opinion, and
  e bwithout hesitation on the subject.bI ought,bI believe, to
  e bconsider this as the voice of Providence, and to acquiesce
  e bin it, as I hope I do. But the whole of this dispensation
  e bhas proved the greatest trial I ever met with.bI cannot
   e see my way at all in it; and I go on, driven, as it were,
  e bby circumstances.bI foresee innumerable difficulties
  e bbefore me, without one certainty of good to follow, and
  e butterly despair of profiting myself or others in England.
  e bI am called to walk bybfaith more than ever: sense is all
  e bopposed.‚Äù

Shortly after the date of this letter, Mr. and Mrs. Corrie sailed
from the Cape for England, and after a prosperous voyage, landed at
Southampton on the 22nd June. Here Mr. C. was made acquainted for the
first time, with the publication of the Journal of Abdool Messeeh,
and the interest excited by it. He heard also, with sorrow, of the
death of Dr. Buchanan. On reaching London he was visited bybseveral
of those friends who interested themselves with the progress of the
gospel among the Hindoos; and at an early day attended a meeting of
the Committee of the Society for Missions to Africaband the East, to
communicate to them information on missionary subjects. He was,balso,
invited to attend a Committee of the London Missionary Society, to
answer enquiries respecting their prospects in India. On all these
occasions Mr. C. endeavoured to shew, that from the co-operation of
many pious individuals among the English in India; from the readiness
with which children were sent to school whenever opportunity was
afforded, and from the eagerness with which translations of the
Scriptures were received by many among the natives, there appeared
tobbe fair prospects of good being done among them. He pressed
upon his friends at the same time, the fact, that but little or
nothing had yet been effected in India, for want of a sufficiency
of labourers,band thatbnothing would be done without them; that
wherever missionaries thoroughly acquainted with the language of the
country     resided, they found plenty to do, and thatbthough few of
the natives of India in comparison with the multitude, shewed any
concern for religion, still the number of such as did so, exceeded
the opportunities of instruction.

It was a gratifying circumstance to Mr. C. to observe, from the
eagerness with which all persons with whom he conversed, enquired
after the progress of missions among the heathen, thatbthere had
been a great increase of zeal for the spread of divine truth, as
compared with the state of religious feeling at the time he left
England in 1806. He expressed himself, also, agreeably surprised to
find thatbthe increased regard for sacred things which he observed
in London, was not less visible in his native village and county; in
the more orderly observance of the Sabbath, and in the attention that
was given by the gentry and clergy to the education of the poor, to
Sundaybschools, and to the support of different religious societies.
On the other hand his affectionate nature was afflicted by hearing of
the death of neighbours and friends;bby learning that some with whom
he had formerly ‚Äúwalked in the house of God as friends,‚Äù had turned
aside from the simplicity of the gospel; and by   ving to witness
the many other changes which the lapse of years never fails to bring
about in families and localities. Deep therefore were the emotions
called forth both in preacher and hearers,bwhen, for the first time
after his return from India, Mr. Corrie occupied hisbfather‚Äôs pulpit,
and urged his surviving neighbours to use the numberless changes and
trials and deaths, that had occurred since he last addressed them, as
a reason for increased anxiety to secure to themselves an enduring
inheritance.[91]

No sooner, however, had Mr. C. somewhat recruited his health, than he
visited his friends, in different parts of England; taking occasion
tobplead the cause of missions, both from the pulpit and at public
meetings, as opportunities occurred. Such portions of his time,
also, as were not thus occupied, he devoted to a revision of the
Liturgy in Hindoostanee. His purpose was,bif practicable, to carry
out with him to India, a reprint of that important translation, for
the use of the native Christians.

In the spring of 1816, Mr. Corrie was engaged to preach the
anniversary sermon for the Church Missionary Society in London. With
reference to that circumstance he wrote


  e b   e b   e b   e b TO J. W. SHERER, ESQ.

   e ‚ÄúI am appointed to preach that sermon, which I would
  e bgladly have avoided: but it was said, ‚ÄòThat many would
  e bbe discouraged if I held back; for thatbthe idea would
  e bbe, thatbthe subject [of missions] was not considered so
  e bimportant by us in India, as it has been represented here.‚Äô
  e bI therefore consented, leaving the issue to God.‚Äù

Before preaching the sermon, however, Mr. Corrie availed himself of
Mr. Simeon‚Äôs judgment and experience; and in transmitting a copy of
the manuscript to that honoured friend, he observed:--

   e ‚ÄúI am deeply sensible of its defects. Being anxious to
  e bintroduce a number of facts,bnot, as I think, sufficiently
   e known, there is too little Scripture quotation; and I feel
  e bit to be wanting in a devotional spirit,bthough I hope the
  e brelation mayboccasion a feeling of compassion, and excite
  e bto exertion in behalf of the heathen.‚Äù

This hope seems, in some measure, to have been realized, for the
accounts given at the time, state thatbthis sermon, which was
preached on the 30th of April, and grounded on Isaiah xliv. 20,
awakened peculiar interest.[92] As,balso, it embodies Mr. Corrie‚Äôs
convictions respecting the moral condition and responsibilities of
the heathen, and developes the means which his experience led him
tobregard as best calculated to rescue the Hindoo from debasing
superstitions; a brief abstract of the sermon cannot well be omitted.
Let it be observed, then, thatbMr. Corrie purposed in the first
instance

   e ‚ÄúFairly to meet the objections made against missionary
   e efforts, as if the present state of the heathen were
  e bunavoidable--as if they were scarcely accountable for their
   e errors,--and our solicitude on their behalf were therefore
  e bsuperfluous.‚Äù

To meet objections of this kind, he goes on to trace the origin of
all false religion, and in this, observes that

   e ‚ÄúIntercourse with heathen nations had inclined him to the
  e bopinion, thatbthe original revelation made to our first
   e parents after their fall, is the ground of all the worship
  e boffered up throughout the world. Thatbthe dispensations
  e bof God to Noah and to the Church before him, must have
  e bbeen known to the family of Noah, and would be remembered
  e bby his immediate descendants; and carried by thembinto
  e bthe different countries, whither they were afterwards
  e bscattered. Hence, it was, he apprehended, thatbthe custom
   e proceeded, of offering sacrifices in worship, by the
  e bheathen tribes of every description, as the only means
  e bof pacifying the Evil Spirit; who, according to their
   e apprehension of him, is going about seeking whom he may
  e bdevour.

   e ‚ÄúBut there are many circumstances in the state of the
  e bidolatrous nations of the east, that discover a still later
   e acquaintance with Divine revelation, than the time of Noah.
  e bMany coincidences in the fabulous histories of the Hindoos
  e bwith the writings of the Old and New Testament, indicate
  e bthatbthe forefathers of that race were not altogether
  e bignorant of the subsequent circumstances of the church of
   e God. Their present deplorable ignorance and error, cannot
  e btherefore,bbe said to arise from any appointment of the
  e bAlmighty; but from their wilful neglect of those notices of
  e bhis will with which they were originally favoured. The sins
  e bof the fathers are thus, in an especial manner, visited
  e bupon their children. The neglect of parental instruction,
  e bby a just connection between guilt and punishment,
  e binvolves their posterity in ignorance, which is the
   e parent of superstition, and the fruitful source of their
   e miseries and their crimes. This view of the subject ought,
  e btherefore,bto be kept distinctly in mind; that we may not
  e bcharge God foolishly with being, in any other waybthan
  e bby the instituted order of connection between cause and
  e beffect,bthe author of that blindness of mind, and hardness
  e bof heart, which excludes the heathen from the divine
  e bfavour. The declaration of God,bby the prophet Hosea,
  e brespecting Israel, is true also of the heathen,bthough in a
  e bsubordinate degree: ‚Äò_Thou hast destroyed thyself_.‚Äô

   e ‚ÄúThese observations are in a particular manner applicable
  e bto the idolatrous nations of India. In their present
  e bcircumstances, viewed by the light of revelation, they
   e evidently appear ‚Äòwithout God and without hope in the
  e bworld;‚Äô not only as they are without Christ, but as their
   e own religious views and feelingsbrender thembtotally
   e incapable of enjoying God,bor of participating in the
  e bhappiness of the heavenly state.‚Äù

Then after reciting many of the superstitious practices of the
heathen, and shewing that the efficacy of any religious rite which
they might perform, was not regarded by thembas being, in any moral
sense, dependent on the state of mind in the worshippers; whilst on
the other hand their idea of sin, being connected with the neglect
of ceremonial observances, and not with moral delinquencies,--they
allowed themselves in all kinds of sensual indulgences, without any
compunctions of conscience or feelingsbof shame;bMr. Corrie proceeded
tobobserve:--

   e ‚ÄúHow then can we avoid the conclusion, thatbthe religious
   e views and feelingsbeven, of these miserable men, do, in the
  e bvery nature of things, exclude thembfrom the approbation
  e bof God, and incapacitate thembfor the enjoyments of the
  e bheavenly state? It is impossible thatba sinner, going out
   e of this world, in expectation of any thing corresponding
  e bwith earthly honours, amusements or enjoyments, should
   e not be metbby disappointment and shame. It is impossible,
  e bthatba soul utterly ignorant of holy, spiritual, and
  e bintellectual enjoyments, should find any place among
   e ‚Äòthe general assembly and church of the first-born; the
  e binnumerable company of angels, and the spirits of just
   e men made perfect.‚Äô Here,btherefore,bthe christian takes
  e bhis firm stand against all who oppose missionary efforts.
  e bThe heathen,bnot only according to the unerring word of
   e God, but by the evidence of facts, are in a perishing
  e bcondition. Without Christ, they cannot be saved. ‚ÄòHe that
  e bhath the Son, hath life;band he thatbhath not the Son of
   e God, hath not life.‚Äô And myriads of these immortal spirits
   e are passing into eternity, whose state and dispositions
   e prove thembto be utterly alienated from the favour of God,
  e bdestitute of spiritual life, and fatally incapacitated for
  e bthe enjoyments of a better world. For without dispositions
   e suited to the enjoyments of the heavenly state, they could
   e no more comprehend the happiness arising from them, even
  e bif admitted to a participation of heaven, than a brute can
  e benjoy the pleasures of reason. And unless this be kept in
  e bmind, it can scarcelybbe hoped, thatba due measure of zeal
  e bfor the salvation of the heathen will be maintained among
   e us.‚Äù

Mr. Corrie then went on to give his reasonsbfor regarding (1st.)
The distribution of the Scriptures in different heathen languages;
(2nd.) The establishing of Missions;band (3rd.) The education of
youth;bas being among the most likelybmeans, under the Divine favour,
tobfurther the rescue of the heathen from their perilous condition;
and he concluded by earnestly exhorting his hearers to do all in
their power to aid in a work so pressing, and involving such fearful
responsibilities.

There seems to be no doubt but thatbMr. C.‚Äôs Sermon on this, asbhis
addresses on other occasions, whilst conveying to the religious
portion of the community, a more accurate conception of the moral
condition of the heathen world, served also to deepen the convictions
of many, that it is a primary Christian dutybto be unwearied in our
efforts to bring the heathen ‚Äúout of darkness into‚Äù God‚Äôs ‚Äúmarvellous
light.‚Äù It was plain also, from his letters and communications
with friends, that this awakened interest on behalf of missions,
actedbvery beneficially onbhis own mind. H   experience whilst in
India had been such, thatbhe had to bear up not only against the
ordinary difficulties inseparable from the missionary life, but
also against the hostility of the government, the indifference of
his fellow-countrymen in India, and the misgivingsbof even good
men, as to the possibility of converting the heathen. He had,
moreover, in a great measure, to maintain schools and teachers, and
scripture-readers, out of such resources asbhis own income and the
occasional contributions of a few Christian friends might supply. But
his residence in England had brought tobhis knowledge the encouraging
fact, that there were thous   s in his native country, who had
become earnestly desirous of promoting the best interests of their
fellow-subjects in India. With reference to this circumstance,bMr.
Corrie had occasion tobremark:--

   e ‚ÄúI was frequently favoured to witness the lively interest
  e bexpressed, by persons in all ranks of life, with regard to
  e bthe state of the heathen.bThe bare mention of some of the
  e bcruelties and superstitions we daily witness, drewbforth
  e btears of commiseration. The news of a single soul turned
  e bfrom heathen darkness to the light of the gospel, drew
  e bforth bursts of praise and thanksgiving to the God of all
  e bgrace and mercy. Nor were these emptybexpressions only; for
  e bthe abundant contributions throughout Britain,bfor carrying
   e on the work of Missions, provedbthatbmultitudes were
   e sincere in those expressions of interest in the cause.‚Äù

When,btherefore,bafter a residence of nearly two years in England,
Mr. Corrie prepared to return tobhis former scene of labour, he
carried with him both a deeper impression of the importance of the
work in which he had been so long engaged, and also, the cheering
consciousness that in such difficulties as might hereafter occur
in his missionary career, he would be accompanied by the prayers
and sympathies of thous   s. Nor could he overlook thatbadditional
encouragement to exertion, which had recently been supplied by
the kind and public manner, in which his labours atbAgra had been
commended by the Bishop of Calcutta.[93]

It maybbe also here mentioned, thatbalthough the frequent public
services in which Mr. Corrie engaged, had not allowed him repose
sufficient to recruit his health so effectually as could have been
desired, yetbhe was unwilling to letbpass any opportunity that
occurred to promote the cause of missions. Within a few days,
therefore,bof his departure from England, he agreed to attend a
meeting of the Committee of the Church Missionary Society in London,
for the purpose of addressing two missionaries who were about to
proceed to India; and the next day he preached a farewell sermon at
the church of St. Mary Woolnoth.

On the 14th of April 1817,bMr. Corrie embarked on board the Carnatic,
Indiaman, with his wife and infant daughter, and the same daybsailed
from the Downs.bThere were on board the Carnatic, besides his own
family and those of the two missionaries above mentioned, upwards of
fortybpassengers, and a detachment of soldiers. ‚ÄúWe have about three
hundred souls on board,‚Äù observesbMr. C. in a letter tobhis father,
‚Äúbut how to setbabout attempting their good, it is difficult to say.‚Äù
As regarded himself,bMr. C.badded:--

   e ‚ÄúA solemn, but not a painful feeling, sometimes fills my
    emind on recollecting my father‚Äôs house, and the distant
  e bprospect of again beholding it; but the consideration of
  e bthe ‚Äòhouse not made with hands,‚Äô quiets every anxiety,
   e and the sure and certainbhope of meeting there may well
  e breconcile us to temporary separation. I have had many
  e bthoughts of late,babout the variety of religious divisions
    ein England, and see clearly,bthatbmost of them arise from
  e bexcess of spiritual advantages; and thus the means intended
  e bfor their good, become to many an ‚Äòoccasion of falling.‚Äô
   e No view of religion but whatbaffects the heart, temper,
   e and life, is of any avail for eternity.bThe great facts of
  e bthe Trinity in Unity, the incarnation and vicarious death
   e of the Son of God, the promise of the Holy Ghost, all
  e bthese remain true and certain,bthough all men should deny
  e bthem.bThe influence they have,btherefore,bupon my heart
  e band life, is the great thing I have to attend to. If I do
  e bso understand and feel these truths, as to engage me in
  e bprivate,band influence me in public, the endbfor which they
   e were revealed is effected in me; and I shall be led by them
  e bto the issue they promise: otherwise they serve no good
  e bpurpose to me.‚Äù

On approaching Madeira he again wrote tobhis father:--

   e ‚ÄúYou will be glad to hear that we have proceeded thus far
  e bin safety.... Our ship is in all respectsbmost comfortable,
   e so that in all things relating to our voyage, we, as yet,
   e have only cause for thankfulness. I hope we may be carried
  e bto our desired haven in peace, and that you will hear of
  e bour continued welfare in that far country; and that we
   e maybyetbagain see each other in the body,bto recount new
  e bmercies, and to excite tobrenewedbpraises. Myemind is kept
  e bin perfect peace; and I am enabled to keep the object of my
    ecalling steadily in view. Less of determination, as to what
   e I shall do, than on my first going to India, but I trustba
  e bfull determination to do what my hand findeth to do, in its
    etime and season.‚Äù

In a private memorandum,bMr. C.bremarks:--

   e ‚ÄúMyemind is, I think,bmore resolutely and deliberately
    esetbupon the work of the ministry in India; more disposed
  e bto spend and to be spent in that service; and to glory in
    eit. I am in danger from the reasonableness and propriety
  e bthatbappear to me in so doing:bfor though it is indeed a
  e breasonable thing, to offer body,bsoul and spirit to the
   e Lord‚Äôs service, yetbreason cannot enable me to doeit. The
   e quickening grace of the Holy Spirit can alone keep the soul
   e alive to God.bThe experience of the Saviour‚Äôs love alone,
    econstrains dull nature, even when regenerated,bto activity
  e bin saving souls. Obfor more experience of a Saviour‚Äôs love!

   e ‚ÄúMay 10th. During the past week,bI have had much thought
   e of life, as a state of endurance, rather than enjoyment.
   e We endure a ship in order tobgo to India: a cabin,bin
  e border tobattainbto a house: medicine, in order tobhealth:
  e bthe society on board, because we cannot getbaway: the
   e inmates, in hopes of doing them good. In the view of these
    ecircumstances, Oh! how great does the goodness of God
   e appear, in His long suffering and patience! May it lead me
   e to a more entire repentance.

   e ‚ÄúAugustb3rd, 1817. Came to anchor in Madras roads, at
   e nine o‚Äôclock A. M. Our voyage has been very favourable,
   e in respect to weather and speed.bAt sea, off the Cape,
   e heard by a vessel, from Bengal, of the death of Mr.
   e Myers:[94] this has proved a severe trial to us; but the
    ecertainty that he died in the Lord,bprevented us sorrowing
    eimmoderately.bThus the Lord is mindful of us, and lays no
   e heavier burden on us than we can bear.‚Äù

The Carnatic reached Madras early in August, and remained there for
ten days or a fortnight. During that period Mr. Corrie and his family
were the guests of his kind friend, the Rev. Marmaduke Thompson. In a
letter written tobhis brother from Madras,bMr. C.binforms him that

   e ‚ÄúThere is a growing respect for religion in this place.
   e Indeed, there are many instances of serious religion
  e bthroughout the Presidency,bboth among the Civil and
  e bMilitary servants of the Company.bThe Chaplains have
  e bentered into a regular communication with each other in
    econnection with the Committee of the Church Missionary
  e bSociety, and at some stations things seem wonderfully
  e bprepared for them.bAt one station wherebMr. Spring is,
   e [Tellicherry], he found that through a native Christian,
   e whom God had stirred upbto read the Scriptures tobhis
   e neighbours, thirteen of the heathen were anxious to be
  e bbaptized,bsome of whom have accordingly been baptized. We
   e hear too, that near Delhi, a company of about five hundred
  e bpeople had collected to converse on the subject of the
   e Christian Scriptures, which had been circulated among them,
   e and that they had resolved to be Christians; although they
   e professed an unwillingness to associate with the English,
   e on account of their eating all kinds of food. I hope they
   e will learn the ways of God more perfectly.‚Äù

The Carnatic sailed from Madras on the 20th of August, and arrived at
Calcutta by the end of that month.

Although Mr. Corrie, at the time he landed in India, was one of the
Senior chaplains in Bengal, and onbthatbaccount had a claimbto reside
in Calcutta, yetbas a junior chaplain had been appointed to the
Presidency during Mr. C.‚Äôs absence from the country,bit was decided
that the latter should proceed to one of the out-stations, until a
vacancy should againboccur in Calcutta. TobMr. C.bwas accordingly
assigned the chaplaincy at Benares. Before, however, he proceeded
to that station, he addressed himself to the work of missions; the
natives as usual flocking around him.bIn reference to that object,bhe
writes tobhis brother:--

  e b     e b     e b     e    e b      ‚ÄúCalcutta, Sep. 22. 1817.

  e b‚ÄúI find a great progress in public opinion respecting
    ethe spread of the gospel.bA Diocesan Committee,[95] and
  e bSchool-BookbSociety,[96] and Hindoo College,[97] are
   e formed;bin addition to the Bible Society, and Church
  e bMissionary Committee, before existing;econsiderable
  e bexertions, also are making to enlarge the Free School,[98]
   e which now boards, clothes and educates upwards of two
   e hundred children. But notwithstanding all these favourable
   e appearances, vital religion has even more than ever to
   e struggle with; a form of godliness without the power of
   e it; a scheme of doctrine approaching to the truth, but
   e still not the truth itself, is the fashion of the day.bTrue
   e religion does however make way, though it ‚Äòcometh not with
   e observation.‚Äô‚Äù

On Sunday, 12th of October, Mr. Corrie preached a sermon at the Old
Church in Calcutta, on behalf of the Church Missionary Society.bThis
seems tobhave been the first discourse delivered from the pulpit
of the Established Church in India, with a professedly missionary
object;[99] and was on thatbaccount not without its effect. After the
service, a native-convert was baptized by the name of Fuez Messeeh.
This person had come from Bareilly tobCalcutta, and had been for
several months under Christian instruction.bThe account which he gave
of himself to Mr. Corrie was,bthatbat the age of eighteen, being
disgusted with the idolatry of the Hindoos, he became a Mahomedan,
and lived so strict a life as tobgain many disciples by his reputed
sanctity.bThat finding nobpeace of mind amid the practice of all
kinds of austerities; and having, in the meanwhile, heard much of
the gospel, he contrived to obtain a copy of Martyn‚Äôs Hindoostanee
New Testament; that he read it, and was led ‚Äúto know and feel that
therebis none other name under heaven, given among men, whereby he
must be saved, but only the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.‚Äù

It was on the evening of Nov. 17, 1817, that Mr. Corrie left Calcutta
for Benares. The following are extracts from his Journal at this
time:--

  e b‚ÄúWe have in company, Abdullah, baptized in England;bFuez
  e bMesseeh, baptized in Calcutta; NoorbMesseeh, baptized
   e at Agra; a Christian Khidmutgar,[100] baptized at the
   e Lall-Bazaar Chapel [in Calcutta]; Khristnoo, baptized
   e at Agra; the five Christian youths, under the patronage
   e of the Church Missionary Society; and several Christian
   e families. During the 19th and 20th, we had an opportunity
   e of witnessing two distressing instances of the unfeeling
    econduct of the Hindoos, towards the sick and dying. On
   e one occasion, two women were employed, at the river-side,
   e filling the mouth of a child with mud. Miss B.basked them
   e if the child werebill? One of them answered, ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô Miss
  e bB. ‚ÄòYou are goingbto kill it outright.‚Äô On which they
   e began to laugh, and talk with each other; and prosecuted
  e btheir work of death. Farther on, a sick man was laid, with
   e several people sitting round.bA young and handsome Brahmin
   e was attempting to bind a weight round his neck, in order to
   e sink him in the river, which the sick man was resisting,
   e with marks of much remaining strength. Abdullah called out,
   e ‚ÄòTake him into some warm place, and he will recover:‚Äô to
   e which the Brahmin answered, with a significant nod, ‚ÄòAye,
   e Aye, we will put him into a warm place:‚Äô on which the
  e bpersons around laughed aloud. On the evening of the 21st,
   e Fuez Messeeh, whilst walking on the bank of the river,
   e said among other things,bthatb‚Äòat times he experienced
   e such delight in contemplating the love of Christ, that no
   e relish remained for earthly things.‚Äô NoorbMesseeh, (who
   e appears truly a partaker of the grace of Christ) joined
  e bus; and after some time asked, with seeming interest,
   e ‚ÄòWhether if a person sinned after believing in Christ, he
   e might hope for forgiveness?‚Äô One of the Christian youths
  e benquired, ‚ÄòWhether if a person did not believe in Christ,
   e and yet practised virtue, his virtue would be accepted of
   e God?‚Äô These questions seem to me, to explain the doctrine
    econtained in the xvi.band xviii.bArticles of our Church.
  e bThe situation of native Christians, in respect of the
  e bMahomedans and Heathen, point out to them the necessity
   e of faith in Christ, in order to acceptance with God;band
   e at the same time, teaches them the inefficacy of a mere
  e bprofession of Christianity.

  e b‚ÄúSunday 24th. Our Christian congregation consisted of
   e seventeen. Fuez Messeeh read first the 116th Psalm, and
   e afterwards the xviband xviith chapters of St. John.bHe
   e was himself evidently affected by the repeated references
  e bto our Lord‚Äôs divinity, and spoke to the others on that
   e subject; and of the greatbcondescension of the Saviour, in
   e becoming the surety of sinners; with the love thatbought to
   e subsist among Christians: saying, ‚Äòthey ought to be as the
   e eyes in the head, which though they dwell in two sockets,
   e yet werebintent always on the same objects; and constituted
   e but one organ of vision.‚Äô

  e b‚ÄúAt Augurdeep. In the evening went into the village, where
  e bis a celebrated Idol temple. Fuez Messeeh entered into
   e a dispute with a Brahmin, beforebtwenty-five or thirty
   e people, assembled for poojah (worship.) The Brahmin was
  e bforced at length tobconfess that Idolatry was inexcusable:
   e on which an appeal was made to the bystanders, who declared
  e bthat the Brahmins led them astray.

  e b‚ÄúDec. 22nd, at Bauglipore. Visited the Roman Catholic
  e bChristians here, whom we found still in greatbpoverty, and
    ecomplaining of the neglect of their priests. Gave Augustine
  e bClementis (who professes to wish for a school and has
   e several children of his own) ten rupees towards erecting
    ea shed, and engaging a schoolmaster, with a promise of
   e further assistance. Left with him, for thebuse of the
  e bintended school, one copy of the New Testament in Persian,
   e one copy in Hindoostanee, and one copy of the Psalms in
   e Persian. Gave him also a copy of the Psalms, and some
    ecopies of family prayers, in Hindoostanee, for distribution.

  e b‚ÄúBuxar, Jan. 18, 1818.bHad divine service this morning
  e bin English, and baptised an Israelite, aged fifty-five,
   e who has been long in our military service, and who seems
   e spiritually alive to the true character of Christ, as
  e bthe promised Messiah. In the afternoon had service in
   e Hindoostanee. Twenty-five adults,bbeside our own people,
   e attended.bThe anxiety manifested by several of the Jews
  e bfor religious instruction,bis very pleasing; and must, if
  e bpossible, be gratified.bMay the Lord raise up a suitable
  e bteacher; and direct and prosper me in my wishes to erect a
  e bplace of worship for them!‚Äù

No sooner had Mr. Corrie arrived at Benares, (Jan. 26. 1818.) than
he projected a missionary establishment in the neighbourhood of
thatblarge and populous city. The following extract from a letter
addressed to the secretary of the Calcutta Committee of the Church
Missionary Society, will explain the objects he had in view:--

  e b‚ÄúThree native Battalions arebusually cantoned here; two
   e are now at the station. I have been taking measures for
  e bthe establishment of a school for thebyounger drummers
   e and fifers, and for thebchildren of native Christians
   e attached to these Corps. I have alreadybtwenty-four
  e bnames of children, whose parents desire that they should
   e become scholars too. We also, on Sunday [Feb. 8th.] began
   e Hindoostanee worship, and about fifteen of the above
    eclass attended.bFor thebschool, I have met with a small
   e bungalow conveniently situated, offered for six hundred
   e rupees. In this bungalow Mr. Adlington could also reside
  e bfor the present. I beg, therefore,bthat the Committee will
    econsider whether they can adopt this bungalow and premises
  e bfor a Missionary residence; or whether they would wish
  e bMr. Adlington to reside altogether in Benares;band that
   e premises should be procured for him there on his return
   e from Agra?[101] Let me repeat, then,bthat at this place
  e bthere are immediate calls on the Society for assistance;
   e and thatbnot merely in the hope of probable benefit, but
   e from the actual wants of professing native Christians;
   e whilst many of the natives,bMahomedan andbHeathen,bare
  e bawakenedbto discern the importance of Christianity, and
    ewill probably be encouraged or discouraged by the readiness
  e bor otherwise which we manifest in meeting these wants of
   e our Christian brethren.‚Äù

Mr. Corrie had the satisfaction to find that the Committee in
Calcutta readily entered into his views, and authorized him to
purchase the premises referred to in the preceding letter.bHe was
thus enabled to open a school, to the support of which many of the
European residents at Benares contributed, by monthly benefactions
and subscriptions.

Early in February Mr. Corrie visited Chunar, his first station in
India, and where the native church was now under thebcare of Mr.
Bowley. It appears from the report he sent to the Calcutta Committee
of the Church Missionary Society, that Mr. C. found the mission at
Chunar in a satisfactory state. Under date of Feb. 9, 1818, he writes:

  e b‚ÄúOn the 5th instant I went to Chunar: it was rather late
  e bin the evening when I arrived, but I found several of the
    econvertedbHindoos waiting to see me. Next morning at seven
   e o‚Äôclock, about eighty of the native Christians attended for
  e bdivine worship.bThey began by singing a hymn,bin the native
  e bmeasures, on the sufferings of Christians.bThe regularity
    ewith which they sung, and the earnestness most of them
  e bmanifested, greatly affected me. Mr. Bowley expounded the
  e bParable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins; and concluded the
  e bservice with prayer. Among other things, he prayed for a
   e blessing on the king, and on his nobles in England, and
    ein India. I mention this not as a proof of Mr. Bowley‚Äôs
   e loyalty, for thatbwas known long before,bbut to shew how
  e bthe labours of such men tend to attach the natives of India
  e bto the British nation, by uniting their most important
  e binterests. At ten o‚Äôclock, about one hundred Europeans
   e attended divine service in English; after which,btwelve
    eof theirbchildren were baptized, and eleven marriages
  e bcelebrated.bAt three p. m., the native congregation again
   e assembled to the number of about ninety adults;bwhen,bafter
   e evening prayer, I endeavoured to explain to them and apply
    ethe second Psalm. It appears that the usual number of
  e bEuropeans who attend Divine service regularly in English,
  e bis about forty, and the usual number of native Christians
   e who attend worship in Hindoostanee,bis about seventy or
   e eighty. The number in both congregations has been gradually
   e and regularly increasing, and testifies of itself to the
    ediligence and exemplary conduct of Mr. Bowley, and of the
    eblessing attending his labours.bThe little I was able,
  e bin my short visit, to see of the state of the people,
  e bimpressed me deeply with the value of his labours.bI knew
  e bthe degradation of both European invalids and their native
  e bwives and families, from three years residence among them,
   e and now to behold so many of them adorning by their lives
  e bthe doctrine of God our Saviour, was to me most gratifying,
   e and will be considered an ample recompencebfor all their
    econtributions, by the supporters of our Society.bThere
    ebeing but one place for both the free-school and the
    econgregation to assemble in,bI could not see the scholars
   e at their tasks.bThree or fourbchildren of parents,bwho
    ecan afford it, pay half a rupee per month; with which,
  e btogether with voluntary contributions of some of the pious
  e bsoldiers, Mr. Bowley has provided wall-shades for evening
  e bservice,band supplies the lights. I,balso,econversed at
   e Chunar with ten Hindoos, who appear to be fully convinced
    eof the truth of Christianity, though not yet prepared to
   e encounter thebconsequences of an open profession [of it].
    eSome of them even join Mr. Bowley occasionally in prayers.
    eOne of them, on being asked, what he considered the great
   e peculiarity of the Christian religion? answered,bThat in
   e every other system of religion, works were made a condition
    eof justification, but that in Christianity, only faith in
   e Christ is required; whilst, wonderful to say, it produced
    emore exemplary holiness than any other system.‚Äù

By a statement which Mr. Corrie put in circulation at Secrole, dated
11th of March, it will be seen that he was not unmindful of the
duties connected with that station:--

  e b‚ÄúIt having been found on enquiry, that many children of
   e Christians,bchiefly connected with the native battalions,
    ewere without thebmeans of instruction, a school was
   e establishedbin the lines,bin the month of February, for
  e btheir benefit, which now consists of the following number
   e and description of scholars:

  e b 4 Adult Christians,blearning to readbHindoostanee in the
  e b   Nagreebcharacter.
    e 2 Adult Hindoos, learning to readbEnglish.
  e b 4 Young men, who were educatedbfor a short time in the
  e b   Orphan school.
  e b 4 Christian youths, who with the last-mentioned, form
  e b e one class in reading, writing, and casting accounts.
    e 5 Christian boys, who readbthe New Testament, and write.
    e10 Christian boys, learning first lessons in English reading
  e b   and writing.
    e 2 Mahomedan boys, learning first lessons in English reading
  e b   and writing.
    e 8 Christian girls, learning to readbEnglish.
  e b--
   e 39‚Äù

Of the above-mentioned boys, eight, it was stated, were orphans, or
thebchildren of parents who were too indigent to maintain them; the
consequence was that they had to be provided with sustenance as well
as education. To the school was also attached a Christian Moonshee,
whose office it was to readbthe Scriptures morning and evening,
to as many Christians as chose to attend; and on Sundays, to read
thebservice of the Church of England, and a previously-prepared
exhortation, (both in Hindoostanee) to the native Christians in the
lines,bof whom about thirty or forty, with theirbchildren, were in
the habit of regularly attending.

The object of this statement was to make the European residents at
Benares acquainted with the missionary operations in progress among
them, and to afford t    ‚Äúan opportunity of contributing to the
support of measures, the beneficial tendency of which they were so
well able to appreciate.‚Äù The result was that the schools at Secrole
received such an increase of patronage,bas to be almost wholly
supported by local contributions.

About the middle of March, Mr. Corrie again visited Chunar. In a
letter from Benares, dated March 24, 1818, he writes:--

  e b‚ÄúI attended at Chunar last week.eOn Good Friday, we
  e bfirst hadbdivinebservice in English,bin a barrack; and
   e afterwards in Hindoostanee, at the Free-school. The number
   e of communicants after thebfirst service,bwas seventeen.
    eOf the native congregation, twenty-seven females and two
    emen remained to commemorate the death of our Lord. Almost
  e bthe wholeecongregation were in tears during the sermon, in
   e which Mr. Bowley set before them the Saviour‚Äôs sufferings:
   e and during the communion, the greater number appeared to be
    edeeply affected, and all of them exeeedingly serious and
   e attentive. There was an evident blessing vouchsafed to us,
    eand, in my own case,ba lively sense of the Divinebpresence,
   e which seemed also to pervade the wholeecongregation. Friday
  e bbefore, I heard t irty-two native Christians read, who
  e bhave within these few months,emost of them, and all of
  e bthem since Mr. Bowley came to Chunar, begun toblearn, some
  e bthe Persian, othersbthe Nagreebcharacter; and some of them
    enow readbthe Scriptures in Hindoostanee, with fluency, and
   e all of them expressed much delight arising from their new
   e attainment. Indeed, a remarkable tenderness of conscience
    eseems to distinguish most of them; and their altered
    eexemplary conduct isbthe talk of all, and as usual, by some
  e bridiculed, and by others commended.

  e b‚ÄúOn Thursday, I catechised thebfirst class in the
  e bFree-school, consisting of seven boys, who not only
  e brepeated theirbcatechism correctly, but answered very
  e bintelligently many questions I asked them, arising out of
  e bthe catechism. They also repeated passages of Scripture,
   e which they got off as tasks,band the wholeeclass repeated
  e bverse by verse,bthe thirteenthbchapter of Proverbs. Some of
  e bthe children in the Free-school, and their mothers, who are
  e bamongst thebmost exemplary of Mr. Bowley‚Äôs congregation,
   e are the families of non-commissioned officers belonging
  e bto native corps now in the field. It must strike every
  e breflecting mind what a comfort establishments such as
  e bthat of the Church Missionary Society at Chunar, must be
  e bto Europeans of the above class. If instead of leaving
  e btheirbwives and children comparatively unprotected, and
    eexposed to the temptations of this heathen land, they could
   e place t    where theirbchildren might receive education
   e at little oreno expense, and their wives be receiving
  e bgood instruction, instead of being left to every wind of
  e btemptation, surely much of the pain arising from separation
   e in time of war would be alleviated.

  e b‚ÄúThe school-room being too small to contain the Native
  e bcongregation, and encouraged by the Committee‚Äôs[102]
   e approbation of my wish to build a larger house for their
   e accommodation, I desired Mr. Bowley toblook out for a
   e proper spot to build upon. A house and premises,bcontiguous
  e bto the barracks, the owner refused to dispose of to us;
   e and this led us to fix upon a spot about two hundred yards
  e bfurther from the barracks, and on two sides bounded by the
  e bNative town. The possessor, Mr. Turnbull, was applied to
  e bfor it, and he begged Mr. G. Robinson tobgo up and fix a
   e price on it. Mr. R. accordingly went with me last week and
   e valued the premises at 500 Rupees. On this being reported
  e bto Mr. Turnbull, he generously wrote, saying, that he
  e bbegged I would accept the ground for thebpurpose intended.
   e This, I hope,bis a token forbgood, and may be taken as
  e ban encouragement to proceed.... I t ink there will be no
    edifficulty in raising 4 ore5000 Rupees for our intended
  e bchurch.‚Äù

Mr. Corrie hadbthe happiness to find t at these anticipations
were not premature, for on a subscription paper being put into
circulation, the Marquis of Hastings was pleased to headbthe list of
contributions by a donation of 1000 sicca rupees, towards building a
church at Chunar.

Encouraging, however, as was thisbimproved state of feeling in favour
of missionary labours, there remained abundant scope for thebexercise
of christian zeal. In a letter, addressed to his brother about this
time, Mr. Corrie writes from Benares:--

  e b‚ÄúIn a neighbouring district (with thebmagistrate of which I
  e bam well acquainted) during the last year, two widows were
  e bburned on an average every month; sixblepersbwere buried
   e alive,bor drowned, by their friends; and not less than
   e onebhundred persons destroyed themselves by drowning, in
   e fits of passion, under the idea that theirbghosts would
  e bhaunt the offending party. Such being the strength of
  e bpassion in them, you will not be surprised that murders
   e are exceedingly frequent: and, what is worst of all, their
   e religion encourages these excesses.... The progress of the
  e bgospel isbslow, but advancing. The unholybrivalry of some
  e bwho differ from us in modes of worshipbis a stumbling-block
  e bto a few; and it grieves me to be often obliged to spend
   e my time and my breath in proving the lawfulness of
  e binfant-baptism, and the propriety of baptism by sprinkling.
    eSatan thus divides,bbut he shall not finally prevail.‚Äù

It was now the will of God to exercise the faithband patience of His
servant, by aeno less severe affliction than the death of an only
son. How great this trial proved to Mr. Corrie, will be seen from his
letter on that occasion--


  e b   e b   e b   e b   e TO MRS. MYERS.

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e    e b   e b   e b   e‚ÄúApril 9, 1818.

  e b‚ÄúOur dearest Grandmama will have heard the melancholy
  e btidings communicated to Mr. Sherer yesterday. I judged it
  e bbest, that, if possible,bthe heavy affliction should not
  e bcome upon you suddenly. Your still bleeding heart will more
  e bseverely feel this arrow of the Almighty, winged no doubt
  e bwith love, but piercing to the very quick. Our lovely boy
  e bwas becoming inexpressibly interesting. He was taken with
   e a severe attack nearly three weeks ago, which yielded to
  e bstrong medicine,bthough he never was after as before, but
  e bseemed mending, when by some means, he caught a severe
  e bcold. The doctoresaysbit was of the nature of Influenza,
   e and many in the house have suffered from it. OneSaturday
   e morning we sent for the doctor; medicines did not produce
  e bthe wished-for effect, and we hadba very restless night
   e on Saturday. OneSunday morning my heart began to sink on
   e his account, and the Lord‚Äôs prayer in Church tried both my
  e bprinciples and my feelings.

  e b‚ÄúThroughout Sunday, little alteration appeared;bbut he
   e rested so well oneSunday night, t at the doctoreon Monday
   e morning pronounced him out of danger. About eleven he
  e baltered for thebworse. His little sweetbcountenance
   e assumed an appearance of eagerness, and about twelve he
  e bwas manifestlybconvulsed,bthough not strongly. Onethis,
   e our doctorecalled in another skilful medical man, who
  e bhappened to be at the station, and new medicines were tried
   e which promised partial relief, and the fond mother began
  e bagain to hope. About twelve on Monday night, he was in
   e great pain, and the work of death was evidentlybrapidly
  e bgoing on. We commended him to our covenant God in prayer.
  e bI pleaded, as well as I was able,bHis promise to be the
  e bGod of our seed, as well as our own God.bI prayed for the
  e bchild as a member of Christ‚Äôs mystical body andba branch
   e ofbthe true Vine; and besought t at the suffering child
   e might be remembered in the suffering Christ. Our prayers
  e bwere mercifully heard, and our babe from t at time suffered
  e bcomparatively little. About five on the morning of the 7th,
   e hisbsoul seemed longing to mount upward. We again in prayer
  e bcommended him to our covenant God, and about half-past
   e five, he ceased to breathebwithout a struggle or even a
  e bsigh.

  e b‚ÄúIt seemed to me inconceivable that my mind should ever
  e bhave become sobconfused respecting the truths of Scripture.
  e bDuring the whole of Tuesday, and on Tuesday night
   e especially, I became alarmed lest any thing extravagant
  e bshould escape me. My God ever graciously kept me from
  e bbringing a reproach on the principles I preach: but O! I
  e bseem only now tobhave begun to understand many of them. I
   e now know what is meant by the _bread_ of affliction, and
  e bthe _water_ of adversity: I now understand the 38th Psalm
  e bin a way I never did before; and though even at this moment
  e bno one Scripture couldbI point to, and say that it supports
   e me, yet, I feel myself onesafe ground, and seem secured on
   e all sides from danger.

  e b‚ÄúI hope the bitterness of this death is past to us both,
  e bthough our bereavement (as I conceive it ought not) will
   e never be forgotten. We are constrainedbto abstract our
  e bthoughts from the lovely object that bound our affections
  e bso fast; and do, we hope, rejoice in his gain, whilst we
  e bmourn our sad loss. My understanding yesterday received
   e a lesson from Anna. When weesat down to the ceremony of
  e bdinner, she became raving forewater. Sometimesbit was ‚ÄòDear
  e bpapa, give Nana some water.‚Äô Thenbwith a curtsey to nurse,
  e b‚ÄòPlease Nan, give Nana some water.‚Äô Thenbwith anger crying
   e forewater; but though our hearts were bleeding foreher
  e bdistress, webwould not give her water foreher hurt. Thus,
   e thought I, our heavenly Father is looking down upon us.
     He heard our prayers, our tears for the life of our babe;
     He saw our distress, and He doubtless pitied, but foreour
  e bgood, denies our desires. Oh, maybthe Holy Spirit send home
  e bthe lesson effectually!

  e b‚ÄúOn entering the pulpit oneSunday morning in heaviness of
   e heart, when I pronounced the sentence ‚ÄòOur Father which art
  e bin heaven,‚Äô it powerfully came to my mind, ‚ÄòIs he less a
   e Father than thou art, t at he should not care for thee and
  e bthybchild?‚Äô Lord! I believe, help my unbelief!‚Äù

In acknowledging the christian sympathybof Captain Peevor, expressed
in connection with this domestic sorrow, Mr. C. writes:--

  e b‚ÄúWe try to realize the truths you kindlybbring before us;
     but it is hard to walk by faith when sense and sight so
  e bpowerfully attract the contrary way. We are not, however,
  e bwithout experience of the grace of our Lord; and hope the
   e lesson intended may not be lost upon us. One day inethis
  e bschool of adversity,bhas taught me more than years of ease
  e band prosperity.‚Äù

Itbwas now, also, t at Mr. Corrie communicated with


   e     e     e     e  THE REV. J. BUCKWORTH.

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e ‚ÄúBenares, March 14, 1818.

  e b‚ÄúYou will see by the date, wherebI am stationed.bThe place
  e bis important, on many accounts. It is central, and near
  e bseveral missionary stations: but we want helpers at Chunar,
   e my first station in India. Mr. Bowley‚Äôs labours have been
   e greatlybblessed to the christian part ofbthe population;
  e bwho were ‚Äòas sheepbwithout a shepherd,‚Äô till he went among
  e bthem. Mr. Adlington is at this time visiting dear brother
  e bAbdool; of whom hebwrites very favourable accounts, as
  e bto spiritual things; but his bodily health has greatly
  e bdeclined, and is declining. A few have been added to the
  e bchurch at Agra; and several bearing the christian name,
  e bseem tobhave experienced a new birth unto righteousness.
   e With respect to the public state of affairs, you will
   e hear of the wonderful events which have taken place here,
  e bduring the last six months; by which the whole continent
  e bof India is become subject to British authority.[103] Very
  e bcritical have been our circumstances repeatedly, at one
  e bplace 1200 of our troops were assaulted by a greater number
  e bof thousands--at another place, 3,000 of our troops were
  e bset upon by 40,000; and such is the inconstant nature of
  e bthe natives of this country, that in either of the above
   e affairs, had victory declared against us, t e whole of
  e bIndia would have been in a flame. This, t en, is the Lord‚Äôs
  e bdoing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. We have many
  e bpraying souls now in our Indian army; and the number is
  e bincreasing: and we know that our God is a hearer of prayer.‚Äù

  e b‚ÄúApril 9. Since I began my letter, it has pleased God to
  e brelieve you of the charge we put upon you, respecting our
  e bInfant.[104] He was removed from our sight on the 7th, and
  e bis now with his Father and our Father, with his God and our
   e God.bI know not how to write about anything else, but yet I
  e bwish not to fill mybpaperewith the expression of feelings
  e bwhich, no doubt, every one in similar circumstances
   e experiences.bI shall only say, that Ibseem never tobhave
  e bknown sadness till now.‚Äù

This extension of the British rule in India, by opening outbwider
fields for missionary exertions, rendered, also, t e want of
labourers more sensibly apparent. Hence Mr. Corrie writes


   e     e     e     e TO THE REV. MR. SIMEON.

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e  ‚ÄúBenares, June 16, 1818.

  e b‚ÄúI write now to acquaint you with the death of one of our
  e bchaplains at Cawnpore on the 22nd instant, t at you may, if
   e possible, get some proper person appointed in his place.
     Our honoured friend Mr. Grant, will not be backward to use
  e bhis influence, if it can avail--and may God grant, for the
   e honoreof his gospel inethese lands, t at a true minister
  e bof his word maybbe sent out. It is inconceivable to those
  e bnot on the spot, how much pious _well-educated_ men may
   e effect, above the usual run, even of pious men who come
  e bout as missionaries.bIf translations be to supply the gift
  e bof tongues, then those translations ought to come as near
  e bthe character of that gift as possible. Now the Serampore
  e btranslations all, I fear, fail entirely ineidiom and
  e bevery recommendation. Of their Hindoostanee translation,
  e bI can speak from some knowledge, that it is calculated to
  e bdisplease the least fastidious, by the mixture of Persian,
  e bArabic, and English words ineit, as well as by the turn
   e given to many phrases, from the literal rendering from
  e bthe English.bThus, ‚Äòon these twobhang all the law and the
  e bprophets,‚Äô the word usedbis literally,b‚Äòsuspended as from a
  e bpeg.‚Äô Such is my own feeling respecting this translation,
  e bthat Ibshould abstain from giving it to an intelligent
  e bHindoo, and no other could make anything of it; and at
  e bthis place, we have, in consequence, nothing to meet the
   e enquiries of the Hindoos, except a catechism translated by
  e bMr. Bowley, which is read with avidity.

  e b‚ÄúDivine providence is, I hope, opening abdoor of great
  e busefulness here, through the means of the Baboo Joy
  e bNarian--a kind ofbDeist,bwho is about giving up a house,
   e and ¬£5,000. to endow it as a school,bto our Church
  e bMissionary Society. The house in Benares we have actual
   e possession of, and it is now undergoing a little repair,
  e bwith a view to commence a school of general learning, of
  e bwhich Mr. Adlington will be the superintendent.‚Äù

The name of JoybNarain will be remembered, as that of the rich native
at Benares, who, some years ago, sent a letter and a benefaction
to the Bible Society.[105] It appears that the same benevolent
individual had at that time formed, also, t e design of building and
endowing abfree-school,bby means of which the poorer classes of his
countrymen might receive education.[106] He seems tobhave gone so
far as tobhave himself drawn up a plan of the institution, tobhave
commenced building a suitable house, and to have offered to pay for
the support of a schoolmaster and assistants; but, from some cause
or other, nothing had been definitely settled up to the time that
Mr. Corrie was appointed chaplain at Benares, after his return from
England.bSoon after Mr. C.‚Äôs arrival at that station, however, Joy
Narain brought the subject of the free-school before him; and the
following extract from a letter addressed by Mr. C. to the committee
of the Church Missionary Society, gives the substance of whatbpassed
between JoybNarain and himself:--

  e b‚ÄúHe proposes giving a large house in the city for a school,
   e endowing itbwith 200 Rs.ba month, (about ¬£300. a year,)
  e bMr. Adlington to be the teacher.bI suggested tobhim to
  e blet us have the house on Mr. Adlington‚Äôs arrival [from
  e bAgra,] to begin operations; and that for the present Mr.
     Abshould derive his support from the Church Missionary
  e bSociety, whilst he (JoybNarain,)bshould pay for books and
  e bincidental expenses.bThis seemed tobdelight him.bI proposed
  e bthat he should make the Church Missionary Society‚Äôs
  e bcommittee trusteeseof his endowment; reserving tobhimself
  e bthe approval of their agent, who, if approved ofbat the
   e end of one year, should be confirmed for life; or, during
  e bconformity with the rules of the endowment; which, I
  e bproposed, should be for general learning: our Missionary
  e bto be at liberty to receive enquirers after truth, in his
  e bprivate apartments, after school-hours.‚Äù

Toethese several propositions, JoybNarain cordially assented, and
although at the date of the foregoing letter to Mr. Simeon, the
property was not legally made over, yet the school-house had been
put into the possession of the Church Missionary Society. The school
itself was opened on Monday, July 17, 1818, under the superintendence
of Mr. Adlington; the second master being abyoung man, country-born,
but educatedbin England, and intimately acquainted with the
colloquial language and manners of the natives. Mr. Corrie observes,
however, to the Committee of the Church Missionary Society:--

  e b‚ÄúTo give full effect to this gift of JoybNarain, you must
  e bsend us one or twobmen of as good education as possible,
   e and as soon as you can find them.bT e disposition to
  e bhear and receive the word, is increasing daily among the
  e bnatives. Many of the rich and learned Hindoos, especially
  e bof this city, seem ready to welcome the gospel.‚Äù

And again to the Committee in Calcutta:--

  e b‚ÄúA man of learning should by all means be sent out to that
  e bschool,bboth to release Mr. Adlington, and to occupy a
   e postbthan which there is none more conspicuous in all the
   e sphere of missionary labour; and, it ought, therefore, to
  e bbe supplied accordingly.‚Äù

Itbwas whilst engaged in watching over the first beginningsbof this
Institution, that Mr. Corrie wrote tobhis brother,

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   ‚ÄúJuly 29, 1818.

  e b‚ÄúThis country becomes daily more and more interesting to
  e bthe christian. The paramount influence of our government
  e bnow seems tobhold out some degree ofbpermanency to our
    erule; and, in consequence, the natives are less embarrassed
  e bwith the fear of the return of former superiors; and
  e bthe consequentbpersecution that would have followed any
  e battention to our religion. Considerate men among them,
   e therefore, begin to speak out their dissatisfaction with
  e bIdolatry; and to enquire whatbbetter we have toboffer
  e bthem.bThis disposition is mostbprovidentially met by the
   e institutions which have risen amongst us of late: and
  e bthe hand of God in disposing all thingsbfor the spread
  e bof His truth, seems evidently displayed.bFirst, there
  e bis the Diocesan Committee, which confines itself to
  e bsupplying those only who understand English, with bibles,
   e prayer-books, and tracts. Next, the Church Missionary
  e bSociety, which supplies the native christians with bibles,
   e and prayer-books in the native languages: as well as
  e bits more direct objects. Then the School-Book Society,
  e bwhich supplies elementary books in all languages, for
   e all description ofbpersons; and then the glorious Bible
  e bSociety, like the ‚Äòlion which covereth,‚Äô embracing all
  e bclasses and climes, in t e distribution of the words
  e bof life eternal.bIf to these be added, the labours of
  e bmissionarieseof different denominations, itbwill appear
  e bthat the kingdom of God is near to India. Of missionaries,
   e however, we have as yet, but a scanty supply. May the Lord
  e bof the harvest, thrust forth labourers into India.

  e b‚ÄúIn the beginning of this month I baptized, at Chunar, a
  e bBrahmin, and a Moonshee, in the presence of the native
  e bchristian congregation, and of many Heathen and Mahomedans.
  e bThe Brahmin declared that he had visited all the places
  e breputed holy by Hindoos, from Brindrinath in the borders
  e bof the snowy mountains in the N. W., to Juggernauth in
  e bthe lower partseof Bengal, but found nothing on which his
  e bmind could rest, till he heard the gospel at Chunar. That
  e bhe found all the Hindoos in error, and plainly told them
  e bso; in proof ofbhis being in earnest, [he] broke off the
  e bBrahmin‚Äôs cord, (or, as he calledbit, ‚Äòthe lying cord,‚Äô)
  e bbefore them all. The Moonshee bore a similar testimony
  e brespecting the insufficiency of the Mahomedan faith.[107]
  e bThree more are waitingbfor my next visit to Chunar in
  e border to be then baptized.... These are encouraging
  e bcircumstances; may God grant us his blessing to improve
  e bthem tobhis glory!‚Äù

But besides relating such encouraging circumstances as these, Mr.
Corrie‚Äôs correspondence contains many incidental notices, also, of
his intercourse with natives of allbclasses.bT us on the 18th of
August, he informs Mr. Sherer:--

  e b‚ÄúWe are going on as usual here, doing a little: ‚Äòunknown
   e and yet well known.‚Äô Severalbof the highbNatives have
  e bvisited me lately; chiefly from the intimacy they
  e bperceived Mr. Bird[108] had formedbwith us; but it led,
   e though they meant it not, to religious discussions. A near
  e brelation of the Rajah of Benares, took away yesterday a
  e bHindoostanee New Testament, and Hindoostanee Prayer-book,
  e bwith evident desire, after a long discussion on subjects
  e bconnectedbwith them.‚Äù

And, again, in writingbto the same relative in the month of October,
Mr. C. observes:--

  e b‚ÄúJoybNarain‚Äôs school goeseon very well. Many of good
  e bcaste and familybnow come for instruction in English. The
   e enquiries they make on religious subjects, have led to the
   e conviction, in several, of the follybof idolatry. Indeed, I
  e bam obliged to refrain at times from talking with them, lest
  e bthe whole design should be obstructed by the rapid progress
  e bsome of them are making in Christian knowledge.‚Äù

The school here mentioned, having, by Deed, bearing date Oct. 21,
1818, been legally placed under the control of the Calcutta Committee
of the Church Missionary Society and their successors, Mr. Corrie
was requested by JoybNarain to draw up, in English, a detailed
statement of the plan and objects contemplated by the school. A
draft of the statement was, in t e first instance, [11th Nov. 1818.]
submitted by Mr. Corrie to the Agent of the Government at Benares,
and was afterwards translated into severalbof the languages of the
country, and circulated among the natives of India. As illustrative
of a remarkable moral movement, towards the maturing of which the
subject of these memoirs materially contributed, the document is too
important to be omitted.

  e b‚ÄúThe following statement of the object and plan of the
   e Institution, is published, with a view to engage such
  e bsupport as may enable the managers to extend to the utmost
  e bthe benefits it is intended to convey.

  e b‚Äú1. In this school, four languages are taught, viz.
  e bEnglish, Persian, Hindoostanee and Bengalee.

  e b‚Äú2. For the purpose of affording instruction in these
  e blanguages, an English master, as superintendent of the
   e Institution, is engaged; proper assistance and learned
  e bteachers in t e other languages respectively, are also
  e bretained.

  e b‚Äú3.bIt is intended to maintain, as well as educate, a
  e bnumber of poor boys, who are to be accommodated in the
   e house, as soon as proper arrangements can be made, and a
  e bsmall daily allowance will be made to such poor boys as
  e bcannot be received into the house, to such extent as the
  e bfunds may admit of.

  e b‚Äú4. The benefits of the Institution to be at the same
  e btime open to all who are desirous of availing themselves
  e bof them, without regard to caste or country; and for this
  e bpurpose,bteachers, paper, pens and ink, will be provided
  e bgratis, for all the scholars; it being left to the option
  e bof such parents as can afford to pay for their children‚Äôs
   e education, to contribute at their pleasure to the general
   e expenses of the school, and thereby to extend the benefits
  e bof itbfurther to the poor.

  e b‚Äú5. The primary design of teaching the above languages
  e bbeing, to enable industrious youths to obtain for
  e bthemselves a comfortable livelihood, the first care
  e bwill be to instruct the scholars in reading and writing
  e bgrammatically, and in the most necessary rules of
   e arithmetic; together with the government regulations on the
  e bsubjects of police, and ordinary affairs: after which such
  e byouths as desire further improvement, may be instructed in
   e general history, geography, and astronomy.

  e b‚Äú6. No scholar to be admitted into the school under seven
  e byears of age, except such as are on t e foundation, nor any
  e bto be admitted to receive maintenance from the funds who
  e bare above eighteen years. Each scholar to remain in school,
   e if practicable, at least twobyears, but no scholar to
  e breceive pecuniary support beyond the period of seven years,
  e bnor above the age of twenty, unless for the pursuit of some
  e bstudy approved by the managers.

  e b‚Äú7. All the scholars are required to attend regularlybevery
  e bday, to abstain from all improper language in school, and
  e bto maintain a respectable moral character in society;
  e bwithout which no scholar can be admitted, or if admitted,
  e bbe retained on his ill conduct being discovered.

  e b‚Äú8. The school to be open to all visitorsbevery Tuesday,
  e band all contributors to the funds to be admitted to inspect
  e bthe accounts on t e second Tuesday in every month.

  e b‚ÄúIt being intended to form a library and museum also
  e bconnected with the school, as soon as practicable, any
  e bdonation of natural curiosities, or of books, in English,
  e bor in anybof the languages of India, (especially grammars,
  e bdictionaries, and books of history)bwill be thankfully
  e breceived; and a book will be kept in which the names of
   e donors will be recorded, with the nature and extent of the
   e donation.‚Äù

  e b   e b   e b   e b   e b   e ‚ÄúBenares, 11th November, 1818.‚Äù

At the time the foregoing statement was put into circulation, there
were no less than one hundred and sixteen scholars in the school; but
it had already become apparent that the monthly sum granted by the
founder, was by no means sufficient to meet the necessary expenses of
the establishment. Joy Narain therefore, made a formal application to
the Governor-General in council for pecuniary assistance, when Lord
Hastings, with the ready attention which he always manifested for
the moral improvement of India, ordered a regular monthly allowance
to be contributed from the funds of government toward the efficient
maintenance of the school.

But the residence of Mr. Corrie at Benares was now drawing to a
close. He received about this time, an appointment to the vacant
Chaplaincy at Cawnpore; but before he could proceed to that station,
a vacancy had occurred at the Presidency by the departure of the
senior chaplain on sick-leave. This event was t e occasion of Mr.
Corrie‚Äôs recall to Calcutta. He accordingly left Benares in December
1818, amid the regrets of a large body of respectable natives, who
had seen so much reason for regarding him as the friend and promoter
of every institution which was calculated to promote their welfare.
It could not, therefore, but be a matter of gratification to him, to
be followed to Calcutta by the subjoined Address written in English,
Persian, Hindoostanee, and Bengalee:--


  e b   e b   e b  FROM THE INHABITANTS OF BENARES,

  e b   e b   e b   e b TO THE REV. D. CORRIE.

  e b‚ÄúFor severalbyears past we have entertained a desire,
  e bthat no one would indulge in anybkind of controversy, and
  e bthat all theological discussion might cease amongst us.
  b  For the attainment of this our desire, Joy Narain Maharaj,
  e boften attempted to establish a school, but was never able
  e bto accomplish his design. When you arrived at Benares,
  e band kindlybengaged the superintendence of a school, in
   e the which instruction should be afforded in the English,
  e bPersian, Hindue and Bengalee languages, from that time
  e bour wishes began to be realized: seeing that as at all
  e btimes it is a difficult thing to collect individuals of
   e different religious principles, you bybyour investigation,
    eliberality and kindness, &c. caused upwards of 200 to lay
  e baside their religious prejudices and engage in the same
  e bpursuit. Since when, by the will of God, you were pleased
  e bto embark for Calcutta,byour condescension, liberality,
  e band charity; your kindness, love for the truth, and enmity
  e bto deception;byour excellent understanding, convincing
  e bknowledge, and acquaintance with the theological works
  e bof the Christian religion; your Christian-like conduct,
   e your affording instruction to those desirous of being more
  e bacquainted with the way of salvation by the mediation of
  e bChrist, and meeting the views of the learner; are subjects
  e bof dailybconversation, and cause us to admire that prudence
  e bwhich, aloof from the violence made use of by those of
   e other dynasties, causes Rajahs, Baboos, greatband learned
  e bPundits, Mouluwees, Moonshees, in fact the greatbof the
   e city, to courtbyour friendship. A remembrance of these
  e bthings occasions much sorrow, and produces a desire for
  e banother interview. Here we trust that God Almightybwill

  e b     e b   e b   e bREMOVAL TO CALCUTTA.


It was not without regret that Mr. Corrie quitted a place which he
had found (to use his own words,)b‚Äúa scene of delightful labour.‚Äù In
anticipation of his probable removalbfrom Benares, he had written
some time before


  e b   e b   e b     eTO THE REV. MR. SIMEON.

  e b‚ÄúI am at a loss to decide how to act should my removal
  e bbe determined on by Government. You will see a report
  e bof our Church Missionary proceedings here, no doubt, by
  e bMr. Thomason. There is a greatbdeal too much said in it
  e babout me, especiallybshould I be removed soon, so as to be
  e bprevented establishing the plans in agitation. But I pray I
  e bmay be able to go on in simplicity of mind, in obedience to
   e the will of God‚Äôs providence, and seek nothing for myself;
  e bwho am indeed nothing,band deserve to be the ‚Äòoff-scouring
  e bof all.‚Äô If I were professedlyba Missionary,band had
  e bthe same prospect of entrance into this very citadel of
   e Idolatry, I should consider it a call to live and die in
  e bthis place; but as a Chaplain of the Government, am I not
  e bto consider the disposal of Government, as the voice of
   e providence to me? I can trulybsay that, in the prospect of
    eleavingbthis place, ‚ÄòI am oppressed; O Lord, undertake for
  e bme!‚Äô‚Äù

Before proceeding, however, to Calcutta,bMr. C. visited Chunar, and
there administered the Lord‚Äôs Supper to sixty communicants, ofbwhom
halfbwere native Christians. He drew up a plan, also, for the future
guidance of those who were engaged in the mission at that place and
Benares, with a view to secure regularity and efficiency to their
exertions: and in this he so arranged as to secure the cooperation
of all the parties, for whose guidance his directions were intended.
It may be mentioned, too, in connexion with the mission at Chunar,
that Mr. C. had employed himself, during his residence at Benares,
in carefully examining and correcting a revision of Mr. Martyn‚Äôs
Hindoostanee translation of the New Testament, into Hindoowee, which
Mr. Bowley had found it necessary to undertake for the sake of the
native population, among whom he laboured; and which was afterwards
printed by the Bible Society. At the close of the year 1818, Mr.
Corrie commenced his journey to Calcutta. On the way thither he
touched at Buxar, a place to which he had frequently paid missionary
visits; and where a greatbdesire had often been manifested on
the part of the Christian inhabitants, to have a schoolmaster or
Missionary located among them. As a proof of the anxiety which these
Christians still cherished for the advantages of a stated ministry,
there was now placed in Mr. Corrie‚Äôs hands a list of about seventy
persons, (chieflybof the less wealthy class,)bwho were willing to
contribute certain monthly paymentsbtoward building a church, and the
maintenance of a Missionary.

On reaching Calcutta,bamong the first objects of Mr. Corrie‚Äôs care
was, the placing under proper instruction some Hindoostanee youths,
who had accompanied him from Benares. He had for some time been in
the habit of devoting much attention to their education, with a view
to their future usefulness as teachers; and he now placed them in a
school for Hindoostanee boys, which the Calcutta Committee of the
Church Missionary Society had just established in that city. With
reference to the importance of such an Institution, Mr. Corrie had
long entertained a decided opinion. In a letter, anterior to this
period, he had observed to Mr. Sherer,

  e b‚ÄúI see so strongly,band experience also in my connection
  e bwith the adult converts, the improbability of finding
  e bsteady,bjudicious pastors, exceptbfrom among those who
  b  have been educated in Christian studies, that I should
    elike to devote t   rest of my days to the instruction of
   e native youths, with a view to the ministry. That may be
  e bbetter done in Calcutta than elsewhere,bfrom the greater
  e breadiness with which booksbmay be had, and especially
  b  help for the instruction of others gotbready. Besides,
   e future Missionaries will act with greater effect, aided by
  e bwell-educated native brethren. So that in every point of
   e view this appears to be a prime object, to educate for the
  e bministry.‚Äù

As respected himself, it is scarcelybnecessary to state that the
scene of labour at the Presidency was, in most respects, widely
different from that to which Mr. Corrie had been accustomed in the
provinces. In a letter to his brother, dated earlybin 1819,bMr. C.
relates, as a specimen of his engagements,--

  e b‚ÄúMr. Parson and myself go on happilybin our joint
  e bChaplaincy. The Bishop is absent at Madras, where,bwe
  e bhear, he is confirming,bin his sermons, allbMr. Thompson‚Äôs
    elabours. He is in many respects a valuable man.

  e b‚ÄúI have lately been appointed Honorary Chaplain to the
  e b[Military] Orphan Institution,[109] where I officiate every
   e Sunday Morning soon after six o‚Äôclock. At the Cathedral
  e bIbread prayers or preach at nine; and the same at eight
  e bin the evening. I take the weeklyboccasional duties in
  e bturn. I am, also, _ex officio_, a Governor of the Free
  e bSchool, and abmember of the Select Vestry; who are Trustees
    eof charities distributed to the monthly amount ofb3,411
  e brupees, among 568 Pensioners.‚Äù

The connexion with the ‚ÄúSelect Vestry‚Äù here mentioned, did not
however prove without its difficulties; for it happened that Mr.
Corrie commenced his duties at the Presidency before a dispute had
subsided, respecting the mode in which that Vestry was constituted,
and the authority which they claimed to exercise. It seems to
have been the custom for the members of the Vestry to re-elect
themselves annually, so as to admit new members into their bodybonly
as vacancies occurred by deaths, resignations, or departures for
England. They had customarily, also, appointed the officers connected
with the Church, now called the Cathedral. But it appears that at
the Easter preceding Mr. Corrie‚Äôs connection with the Cathedral,
a certain number of persons opposed the re-election of the Select
Vestry, as being contrary to the practice usual in England; and the
seniorbChaplain, at the same time, claimed th  right to nominate
the churchwardens. The Select Vestry, on the other hand, regarded
themselves (and had long been so recognized by government) as
special Trustees for a Church which had been originally built by
private individuals; and for the due distribution of certain funds,
arising mainly from legacies leftbfor charitable purposes, and
under the administration of the Vestry. However much, therefore, to
be deplored, might be t   animosity and indecorous language, into
which some of the parties concerned in the dispute, seem to have
been betrayed, it cannot be a matter of surprise that the Vestry,
as a body, should hesitate to abandon long-acknowledged claims,
and to hand over to other persons, the distribution of certain
charities which they conceived to be legally entrusted to the Vestry.
To such a length, however, had the dispute respecting thisbmatter
been carried, that both parties complained to the Governor General
in Council; and the Government had given it as an opinion, rather
than as a decision, that the vestry should remain in possession of
its accustomed functions, until the authorities in England might
judge it proper to interfere. But notwithstanding thisbopinion on
the part of Government, the opponents of the Vestry revived the
dispute, at the Easter of 1819. Much correspondence seems to have
taken place on the subject, and many hard words again to have been
used; and Mr. Corrie as one, among others, who considered it their
duty to maintain themselves in the position which had been thus
sanctioned by Government, became, as a matter of course, the subject
of reprehension on the part of those, who opposed the claims of the
Vestry. Yet it is stated by those who were in Calcutta at the time,
and were also well acquainted with the facts of the case, that the
subject of these Memoirs was enabled so far to keep apart from the
bitterness of this strife, as to exhibit throughout ‚Äúthe prudence and
meekness becoming the minister of Christ.‚Äù

With the exception, however, of passing occurrences such as these,
there was but little diversity in the duties which now fell to Mr.
Corrie‚Äôs lot, beyond what may be found in the life of a parochial
clergyman. The history of anybone day was, to a great extent
therefore, the history of the succeeding month; and so on, from
month to month: for as it was not yet certain, whether the senior
Chaplain, who had gone to the Cape,bwould return to India or not, Mr.
Corrie could not regard himself as more than a temporary resident at
the Presidency, and did not therefore feel at liberty to engage so
actively in the concerns of severalbreligious societies in Calcutta,
as he afterwards felt called upon to do. But when intelligence
reached India, early in 1820, that the seniorbChaplain had proceeded
to England, and Mr. C. thus became entitled to succeed to the vacant
chaplaincy, he began to lay himself out for some steadybcourse of
missionary labour in Calcutta and the neighbourhood. One of his first
movements was, to endeavour to collect a native congregation in
Calcutta, by means of Mr. Bowley, who had come down from Chunar to
superintend the printing of that revised Hindoowee translation of the
New Testament, which has been already mentioned.[110] The ulterior
object Mr. Corrie had in view in this was, to provide a sphere of
labour for Abdool Messeeh, who was expected to reach Calcutta in the
spring of 1820, and whose state of health might probably render it
desirable that he should remain there for the future. Mr. Corrie was,
also, desirous to excite a deeper interestbfor missionary objects,
among the poorer classes about the Presidency, in the belief that
less attention had hitherto been given to effect this, than, on
every christian principle, seemed necessary. As having now, also,
undertaken the office of Secretary to the Church Missionary Society
in Calcutta, Mr. C. was in better circumstances to direct these
missionary plans. Some account of hisboccupations, is given in a
letter to his sister, who had returned to England:--

                                                   ‚ÄúMay 19, 1820.

     ‚ÄúAbdool Messeeh isbhere: I am daily at work with him,
     writing a Commentary in Hindoostanee, from six in the
     morning till breakfast and after, if I am not called away.
     We have got him a house in _Meer-jan-kee-gully_. It is a
     roomy (upper-roomed) house, but out of repair; so we get
     it for fifty rupees a month; and here he collects the poor
     four times a week. The Church Missionary concerns occupy
     me too a good deal; and we are setting up a printing-press
     in my go-downs.[111] To-day the first sheet of a tract is
     printing off, as a beginning.‚Äù

Soon after the date of the foregoing extract, Mr. Corrie had an
examination of the boys of hisbHindoostanee-school, in the presence
of the members of the Calcutta Committee of the Church Missionary
Society, and of such other persons as interested themselves about
missionary objects. His many avocations did not admit of his
undertaking the superintendence of a larger number of scholars than
that with which the school had commenced; but the result of the
examination proved, that the benefit derived from being habituated
to christian example and the progress which the boys had made in
a knowledge of the Hindoostanee New Testament, the Hindoostanee
Catechism, and the principles of the Christian religion in general,
were of a very encouraging nature. Impressed, therefore, with the
conviction that a Christian education was of the greatestbimportance
as a means to render the natives themselves efficient instruments of
God to their countrymen, Mr. Corrie welcomed the idea of establishing
a missionary College by the Bishop. With reference to that
circumstance, he wrote to his brother:--

     ‚ÄúI am quite sure that all men will rejoice in the
     establishment of the College; although learning alone will
     do but little. It therefore appears to me more than ever
     necessary to maintain strenuously the labours and plans
     of the Church Missionary Society. Under these feelings
     I was led last Thursday into a long conversation with
     the Bishop, respecting Missionary proceedings, in which
     the Church Missionary Society and its views were brought
     forward and discussed. The Bishop‚Äôs chief objection was,
     that the sending out of English clergymen as Missionaries,
     would prevent the East India Company from making such a
     provision of Chaplains, as they ought to make. As far as it
     goes, the argument is just; but I think he ought rather t        adopt such Missionaries, and by pointing out to Government
     the benefits produced by them, to draw forth Government
     support, which otherwise may not be afforded in any way.‚Äù

It may not be amiss to mention, that however much Mr. Corrie might
be occupied by matters of public interest, he did not neglect the
charities of social life. On the contrary, he did not allow his gate
to be closed against any who might have a reason for desiring to
hold communication with him. And, as in India, persons arriving from
England, or visiting the Presidency were, at that time, regarded as
having an almost unlimited claim on the hospitality of the residents
in Calcutta, Mr. C. was seldom without his share of such guests. This
circumstance, added to his natural kind-heartedness, gave occasion t   one, who loved him,         was then under hisbroof, to remark, ‚Äòas
long asbhe lives a     ereverbhe lives, he will have as many people
about him as fall in hisbway; until every corner be occupied, and he
himself is left without a corner.‚Äô To many of the younger portion of
these visitors Mr. C. was, also, oftentimes the instrument of great
moral good; and in such cases it was his custom, as occasion served
or might require, to address to them a letter of encouragement or
direction, after they had left him. An extract from a letter to Capt.
Moyle Sherer, H. M. 34th regiment, a       had been on a visit to
his brother in Calcutta, may serve to illustrate the spirit of such
communications:--

                                         ‚ÄúCalcutta, May 27, 1820.

     ‚ÄúYou are by this time settled with your regiment, a   begin
     to find exactly how the minds of those around you stand       affected to the principles of true religion. Some painful
     discoveries will probably have been made, and on the other
     hand, perhaps, consolation will have arisen from unexpected       sources. Such is the beginning, especially of a life of
     piety. We are apt t  wonder that what we see so clearly to
     be rational and necessary, is not equally seen by others
     when brought before them; and the result is, to make us
     feel more experimentally that what we have learned on these
     subjects, has not been from man‚Äôs teaching, but that God
     has been leading us by ways that we knew not. The discovery
     of our own inbred sin is what is most distressing at this
     stage. Indeed, to the end of life such ebullitions of the
     sin that dwelleth in us, occasionally take place, as almost
     confound the Christian, and send him back to his first
     principles; and it seems as if the whole work of religion
     were yet to begin. Yea, how often does this inward enemy
     impel him to the very brink of disgrace, and he escapes
     as by miracle, from temporal no less than eternal ruin.
     Such is my experience up to this day; and now, what with
     the experience upwards of forty years have supplied of the
     world‚Äôs insufficiency to afford happiness, and of the power
     of sin, unless God prevent, t  work temporal and eternal
     ruin, the grave begins to appear a refuge, and I have a
     deep conviction that they only are completely blesse           are in heaven. I think you were quite right in not taking
     part with the Wesleyans till you know more of them. By
     degrees the truly sincere will draw to you as their natural
     superior, and you will be able to direct their reading and       to regulate their affairs far more to their advantage than
     they can do themselves.‚Äù

During the October of 1820, Mr. Corrie was afflicted by the death of
one of the elder of the Hindoostanee boys, w   were in the school
under hisbcare. The youth in question was a Hindoo by birth, a     en
a child had been purchased up the country, from his parents, during a
season of scarcity. He had therefore been under Christian instruction
the greater part of his life. It seems that he died of consumption,
and that during a long illness, he had afforded satisfactory evidence
that he had not received a Christian education in vain. The death of
this youth was not long afterwards followed by the removal of the
remaining youths, to assist in the schools at different missionary
stations. Before, however, Mr. Corrie‚Äôs Hindoostanee scholars had
been thus dispersed, there had been admitted among them, for the
purpose of receiving instruction in order to baptism,   Hindoo youth
    had been servant to a converted Moonshee.[112] This youth,
  en full of the idea of making the pilgrimage to Juggernauth, had
accidentally fallen in with the Moonshee,     accompanied him as far
as Benares. In consequence, however, of the conversations, which
he held with the Moonshee on the subject of religion, his faith in
the efficacy of a pilgrimage to Juggernauth had entirely abated, by
the time they reached Benares: and he accordingly returned back
to Delhi with the Moonshee, in the capacity of servant; although
he left his master, after a while, to avoid the scoffs of his
Hindoo acquaintances. He could not, however, rid himself of the
conviction that his master was right, a   became so uneasy under that
conviction, that he quitted his home in search of peace of mind.
Eventually he made his way to Calcutta, a   became an inmate of the
Hindoostanee school there, and in due time was baptised.

It may here not be uninteresting to relate, that after Mr. Corrie
became Secretary to the Calcutta Committee of the Church Missionary
Society, he was in the habit of employing himself as he found  opportunity, in contributing to the pages of a ‚ÄòQuarterly Circular,‚Äô
  ich first appeared in 1820, and contained from time to time, a
summary of ‚ÄòMissionary Intelligence,‚Äô for the use of Missionaries and  others, at the different stations in India. Among hisbcontributions
to this periodical may be mentioned a series of papers, containing
a ‚ÄòSketch of the progress of Christianity in Calcutta and in the
provinces of the presidency of Bengal.‚Äô Mr. Corrie had often been
struck by observing the importance attached by historians to but
imperfect records of former ages, provided those records happened
to bear the marks of authenticity; and he conceived, therefore,
that some future historian of the church of Christ in India,
might possibly derive assistance from a notice of such facts and  circumstances as that ‚ÄòSketch‚Äô might be the means of rescuing from
oblivion. It may with truth be added, that no person then living was
better qualified than Mr. C. to record the more recent occurrences
connected with the history of Christianity in Bengal, he having
himself been not only a careful observer of all that concerned the
progress of true religion in that Presidency, but also the personal
friend of those men of God, w   had immediately preceded him, and t  whose zeal and labours may be traced the first origin of almost every
religious institution in Bengal. The Calcutta Diocesan Committee of
the Society for promoting Christian knowledge, having now, also,
directed their attention to the translation of religious Tracts int  the languages of India, a translation int  Hindoostanee, both in
the Nagree and Nustaliq character, of ‚ÄúSellon‚Äôs Abridgment of the
Holy Scriptures,‚Äù was assigned to the superintendence and revision
of Mr. Corrie. Having been requested, m   over, by the Committee of
the Calcutta Bible Society,    state for their information, such
particulars illustrative of the benefit attending the circulation of
the Holy Scriptures, as might have fallen under hisbown observation,
the following was hisbreply:--

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, 6th Feb. 1821.

     ‚ÄúIn compliance with your request that I would state any
     circumstances within my own knowledge, tending to shew
     the good arising from the distribution of the Scriptures
     alone, I have endeavoured to call to mind some facts in
     corroboration of my general feeling of the good arising
     from the measure in question. The benefit arising t       professed Christians is not, I believe, within your
     contemplation, otherwise I might say much respecting the
     benefit the native Christians on this side of India have
     derived from the Bible Society. During the prevalence
     of the Mahratta power, many Christians were employed
     in offices of trust by the Native princes, chiefly in
     situations connected with the army.

     ‚ÄúI had, whilst residing at Agra, frequent applications from
     Christians of that class,     many of them sent from far,
     for copies of the Persian a   Hindoostanee translations: t       shew the need they stood in of such supplies, I may just
     observe, that a Christian of the class referred to, in the
     service of the Burthpore Rajah, on applying personally to
     me for a copy of the New Testament, was asked if he had
     ever perused the Gospel in any language? he answered that
     he had never even seen the Book; and in the figurative
     language of the country, added, that ‚Äòhe knew not whether
     the Book was made of wood or paper.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúAmong the most remarkable instances of Mahomedans and       Hindoos deriving benefit from the Scriptures alone, the
     following occur to me:

     ‚ÄúIn 1813, a Mahomedan Hukeem came to me at Agra from
     Burthpore, saying, that he had many years before read the
     Pentateuch in Arabic, a copy of w ich had been given to him
     by a Roman Catholic priest: that about two years before the
     time he came to me, he had obtained a copy of St. Matthew‚Äôs
     gospel in Persian, from reading of w ich he had become
     convinced of the divinity of Jesus Christ. This man, with
     his son, was afterwards baptized.

     ‚ÄúThe next instance that occurs to me, is of an aged Hindoo:
     this man from reading the writings of Cuber, had been
     led to renounce Idolatry, and finding the Law and Gospel
     spoken of by Cuber, as divine books, he was for several
     years anxious to possess a copy. After several ineffectual
     attempts to procure a copy from English gentlemen, he at
     length obtained the Gospels in the Nagree character. He was
     also afterwards baptized. A third instance of good derived
     from the Scriptures alone, was Burukut Museeh in 1813; he
     got a manuscript copy of Job, which he perused with great
     interest; afterwards he got a copy of the Psalms; then
     Isaiah; and finally the New Testament in Hindoostanee.       His exemplary life and happy death are recorded in the
     Missionary Register.

     ‚ÄúThe only other case that occurs to me, is that of Fuez
     Musseeh, baptized in 1817. At seventeen years of age, he
     became a Mahomedan purely from the abhorrence of idolatry
     expressed in the Koran; he remained upwards of twenty
     years a strict and indefatigable disciple of the Koran,
     living as a Fakeer and obtaining great honour among his
     countrymen for his supposed sanctity. At length, being
     disgusted in hisbown mind with the practices recommended by
     his spiritual guides,     wearied with hisbown ineffectual
     labours after holiness, he abandoned all hisbhonours as
     a Religieux,     bought from a lady a copy of the New
     Testament, if haply he might find in it that rest for his
     soul he had hither   sought in vain from other quarters.       He sought, and found, as hisbconduct hither   leads us to
     think, the object of hisbpursuit.

     ‚ÄúI have met whilst residing out of Calcutta, with very many
     natives, who from reading the Scriptures, have had all
     prejudice against Christianity removed;     some of them,
     as Joy Narain Ghossaul,  t Benares, have been set upon many
     works of benevolence     charity, from their knowledge
     of duty as learned from the Bible, though they have not
     derived _all_ the benefits to be desired from the copies
     of the Scriptures circulated among them. How far this      partial good is to be appreciated, each Christian will form
     hisbown judgment. As a preparing of the way of the Lord, it
     is by no means to be undervalued, and future labourers will
     reap the fruit of the precious seed w ich the Bible Society
     has been sowing in India with so much diligence for several
     years past.‚Äù

The memoranda which occur in Mr. Corrie‚Äôs Journal after his return t  India, are very few, but under date of June 11, 1821, he remarks:--

     ‚ÄúI have been endeavouring to call my ways to remembrance,
     and find enough to be humbled for in the review, but a
     difficulty as to how I should speak of it. This difficulty
     I wish to account for. Formerly I could write of my state
     with ease; lately I have neglected to make memoranda.
     I have cer ainly been much employed in public matters.       My duties as Chaplain, and as Secretary to the Church
     Missionary Society,--the schools, the press, leave me very
     little time, and that little I find difficult to apply to a
     good purpose. My want of retirement prevents the right use
     of the little I might have. I am deeply conscious that the
     evil propensities of my nature are by no means eradicated;
     and I ought to be alarmed that they do not more alarm me.       I feel daily that I sin, and resolve daily against my
     propensities, yet daily am more or less overcome. Oh! I
     desire to awake to righteousness! I desire to be alarmed;
     to be saved from sin, and quickened and made alive to God.       O Spirit of light and love, of power and of a sound mind,
     work in me to will and do of thy good pleasure! I see, in
     reading the epistle to Titus, that except in such points as
     are agreeable to my nature, I am far from the character of
     a true minister of Christ.‚Äù

There is reason, however, to hope that Mr. Corrie‚Äôs ministrations in
Calcutta were not altogether in vain. At any rate, it is well known
that his labours were unceasing, whether regard be had to his duties
as chaplain, or those connected with the Church Missionary Society,
and the superintendence of the native schools. In the December too,
of this year, he was appointed to preach the sermon at the third
visitation of Bishop Middleton; and in the same month printed,  mong
the Quarterly Missionary Intelligence, a biographical sketch of his
old friend Joy Narain, who had died at Benares in November.

But that w ich now more especially occupied the attention of Mr.
C. and others, engaged in conducting the affairs of the Church
Missionary Society in Calcutta, was the education of the native
females of India. The state of society had until lately, seemed
hopelessly to exclude the native female from all share in the
benefits of education; but the success w ich had attended a school
set on foot by the Baptist mission, had induce  some friends of
religion in India, to communicate with the British and Foreign
School-Society in Engl   , with a view to extend the means of
instruction t  the females of India, as widely as practicable. Funds
were in consequence, raised for that purpose;     Miss Cooke, a lady
of education a   piety, arrived in Calcutta during Nov. 1821, for the
purpose of devoting herself to the work.

It was early in January 1822, that the Calcutta Committee of the
Church Missionary Society, took measures for the formation of female
schools, under the superintendence of this lady;     such was the
success attending their first efforts, that three schools were in
operation by the middle of February. It was then thought desirable
to bring the subject more distinctly before the residents in
Calcutta, in the hope that the friends to the moral and intellectual
improvement of the natives of India, might be induce  to assist
in carrying on this important and difficult undertaking: and to
Mr. Corrie it was assigned, to draw up and circulate the following
address:


                      ‚ÄúNATIVE FEMALE EDUCATION.

     ‚ÄúThe importance of education, in order to the improvement
     of the state of society among the natives of this country,
     is now generally acknowledged, and the eagerness of the
     natives themselves for instruction begins to exceed the
     opportunities hitherto afforded them.

     ‚ÄúBut to render education effectual to the improvement of
     society, it must obviously, be extended to both sexes. Man
     requires a ‚ÄòHelp-meet;‚Äô and in every country the infant
     mind receives its earliest impressions from the female
     sex. Wherever, therefore, this sex is left in a state of
     ignorance and degradation, the endearing and important
     duties of wife and mother cannot be duly discharged; and no
     great progress in general civilization a   morals can, in
     such a state of things, be reasonably hoped for.

     ‚ÄúSuch however, with few exceptions has hitherto been the
     state of the female sex in this country; but a happy
     change in this respect seems at length to be gradually
     taking place. A most pleasing proof of this occurred in
     the interesting fact, that thirty-five girls were among
     the number of scholars, at the last examination of the
     School Society, in the house of one of the most respectable
     natives in Calcutta.

     ‚ÄúThe arrival of a lady of judgment and experience, at such
     a crisis, for the purpose of devoting her time and talents
     to the work of native female education, could not but be
     regarded, by all interested in the improvement of society
     among the natives of this country, as a most favourable
     event.

     ‚ÄúThis lady (Miss Cooke) was recommended, in the first
     instance, by the British and Foreign School Society, t  the
     Calcutta School Society; but the Committee of this Society,
     being composed partly of native gentlemen, were not
     prepared unanimously and actively to engage in any general
     plan of native female education. Most of these, however,
     have expressed their good-will towards such a pl  , and
     their intention of availing themselves, as circumstances
     may admit, of Miss Cooke‚Äôs disinterested services to obtain
     instruction for their families.

     ‚ÄúUnder these circumstances the corresponding Committee of
     the Church Missionary Society have cordially undertaken
     to promote, as they may be enabled, the objects of Miss
     Cooke‚Äôs mission.

     ‚ÄúMiss Cooke will, as she may find opportunity, afford
     instruction at home to the female children of the higher
     classe     natives; and at the suggestion of an enlightened
     native gentlema , a separate school will be attempted,
     for poor female children of high caste, with a view to
     their becoming hereafter teachers in the families of their
     wealthy country-women.

     ‚ÄúMiss Cooke has already made sufficient progress in the
     acquirement of Bengalee, to enable her to superintend the
     establishment of schools;     having been attended in her
     first attempt by a female friend, who can converse in
     Bengalee, some interesting conversations took place with
     the mothers of the children first collected, in which Miss
     Cooke‚Äôs motives were fully explained to them. Soon after,
     a petition was presente  to Miss Cooke, in consequence
     of which, a second female school has been established
     in another quarter of the tow , and a third school has
     been formed in Mirzapore, near the Church Mission-House.
     Thus three schools are already established under Miss
     Cooke‚Äôs immediate care, containing about sixty girls; and
     the disposition manifested towards these schools by the
     natives, affords reason to expect that a wish to have
     female schools will in time become general.

     ‚ÄúIt is intended therefore, to erect in a suitable situation
     in the native tow , a school-room, with a dwelling-house
     attached, in which an extensive system of female education
     may be attempted; and this plan, so peculiarly within their
     province, is submitted, with much respect and confidence
     of success, t  the sympathy and patronage of the ladies
     of this Presidency, by the corresponding Committee of the
     Church Missionary Society. Whatever assistance may be
     afforded, either as donations or monthly subscriptions,
     will be exclusively applied to the purposes of female
     education, and a report of progress will be submitted,
     from time to time by Miss Cooke, for the information of
     subscribers.‚Äù

                                     ‚Äú_Calcutta, Feb. 23, 1822._‚Äù

The result of this appeal was, that within a few weeks not less
than 3,000 rupees were subscribed for the furtherance of the object
contemplated; the Governor General, Lady Hastings, and others of the
first distinction being among the most liberal of the contributors.
Nor was it among the least remarkable circumstance connected with
this great social movement, that a highly respectable Brahmin wrote
and circulated a tract, for the express purpose of recommending to
his countrymen the importance of female education. He urged it also,
as the duty of every parent to rescue thus their female offspring
from that state of degradation, to which (as he proved from history)
the women in Hindoostan were not formerly subject.

With reference to these and similar occurrences, Mr. Corrie writes to
his brother.

                                       ‚ÄúCalcutta, April 19, 1822.

     ‚ÄúOur missionary engagements are becoming more and more
     important; and opportunities for extending our plans more
     and more frequent and easy: But with all these [prospects,]
     a spirit unfriendly to the gospel is gone forth amongst the
     natives, and they are commencing Deistical politicians.
     Four native newspapers have started in Calcutta; two in
     Bengalee, one in Hindoostanee, and one in Persian. They
     cannot all stand long, but they mark the spirit of the
     times. They are all under an influence unfriendly to our
     Church establishment: but we are getting on with our
     schools, having now upwards of four hundred boys, and one
     hundred and thirty-four girls, under our Church Missionary
     Society, within the boundary of Calcutta; while the
     Diocesan Committee have several schools in the suburbs.
     The youth in these [schools] will, we hope, grow up with
     impressions favourable to our views of things.‚Äù

On Wednesday, May 26, 1822, Mr. Corrie preached a sermon at the
Old Church, in aid of the Society for Missions to Africa and the
East. The sermon was afterwards printed with the fifth report of
the Calcutta Committee of that Society, and contains some valuable
remarks on the advantages connected with direct instruction in
the faith of Christ, over the education which merely imparts such
knowledge as has reference only to the affairs of this life. One
sentence may here be cited as illustrative of the great change which
the mind of India had undergone, since the time when Mr. Corrie
could labour for the conversion of the heathe , only at the risk of
incurring the censure of government:--

     ‚ÄúOur Church, with reason we think, calls herself
     Apostolical: now, what is this but missionary? And a
     portion of missionary spirit has always resided among her
     members. Time has been, indeed, when this was regarded by
     many rather as a mark of dissent; but now, blessed be God,
     she seems to be rising, through all her ranks, t  her high
     and proper character as a missionary body.‚Äù

About six weeks only had passed since the delivery of this discourse,
when Mr. Corrie was summoned to attend the death-bed of the Bishop of
Calcutta, who was called t  his rest after but a few days‚Äô illness.
Considering the peculiar circumstances of India, and the the  novelty
of episcopal rule in that country, it could scarcely be expected that
Mr. Corrie, among others, should be able to recognise the wisdom
of every act of Bishop Middleton‚Äôs administration, and the equity
of the control which that able prelate claimed t  exercise over
the temporal as well as spiritual affairs of the chaplains to the
East India Company; but his correspondence abundantly shows that
he could well appreciate the Bishop‚Äôs character. With regard more
especially to the cause nearest his heart--that of missions, Mr. C.
considered it t  have derived from the deceased prelate, exactly that
kind of sanction which was then required; it wanted only official
countenance, and the reputation of orthodoxy. To labour for the moral
improvement and conversion of our heathe  fellow-subjects, used to be
regarded as characterising a party in the church, and as proceeding
from a kind of fanaticism that would endanger the stability of
our oriental empire. But the interest which Bishop Middleton had
taken in the Missionary cause, had given reason to believe, that
official dignity combined with a high reputation for sound judgment
and secular learning, were not incompatible with the conviction,
that our rule in India had every thing t  hope from the spread of
Christianity; and that it was not fanatical to suppose, that so vast
an empire had been committed to our governance for the noble purpose
of making known the Son of God, to a people who were ignorant of Him.

Within two months of the death of Bishop Middleton, the Archdeacon
of Calcutta fell a victim to the Cholera; and as that circumstance
rendered it necessary for the Government to delegate the
administration of the affairs of the See to other hands, Mr. Corrie
and Mr. Parson were commissioned t  exercise such jurisdiction as by
law might be warranted, until a successor to Bishop Middleton should
arrive from England.

In a memorandum, penned about that time, Mr. Corrie writes:--

     ‚ÄúSep. 28th, 1822. This day sixteen years ago I first landed
     in Calcutta. How altered the state of society! Then Mr.
     Brown was senior Chaplain. He had at time dear Martyn in
     his house, and received Parson and myself into his family.
     Now he and his wife are numbered with the dead, and all
     their children returned.... How many other changes, also,
     in the state of the religious society of Calcutta, so that
     Mr. U. only remains of the friends of religion in his class
     of society of that day. How varied has been the scene of my
     own Indian-life!

     ‚ÄúIn respect of public affairs, great changes, also, have
     taken place. In ecclesiastical matters great changes. A
     bishop and archdeacon appointed in 1814, and Bishop‚Äôs
     college has been the result. The subject of missions
     has thus, by degrees, become one of acknowledged duty
     and advantage to society. The bishop hurried off by
     sudden death: the archdeacon taken off not two months
     after, more suddenly still: Parson and I appointed to
     exercise their functions _pro tempore_. I would, however,
     remark especially the state of my own mind during this
     long period. I came to India chiefly with a view to the
     propagation of the gospel; and that view, I trust I
     can say, has not been lost sight of. My time has been
     principally devoted to that object. My money, t o, has
     chiefly gone in that cause. I trust a mission has been
     established at Chunar, Agra, and Benares, through my
     humble means, which will go on, and ‚Äòincrease with the
     increase of God.‚Äô In Calcutta, the labours of Secretary
     to the Church Missionary Society, in addition to my own
     official duties, have helped to bring on the loss of
     strength I am now suffering under. But I would be aware
     that the state of heart is chiefly to be attended to. And
     here I can see no one duty so performed, that I dare think
     of it in the view of presenting it t  God; and were it not
     that Jesus is the righteousness and strength of all who
     believe, I could not entertain the slightest hope.

     ‚ÄúFor about three months, my ancles have swollen
     occasionally, with bad digestion, and aching of the limbs
     and legs. The doctor says it is the effect of climate; by
     which I understand that my frame is debilitated sensibly,
     by the heat. He says, rest is the only remedy, and I am
     come to Pultah Ghaut[113] for rest, and retirement. My
     prayer to God is that I may be made fully alive to my real
     state, and may not waste away without feeling the tendency
     of such a wasting. I desire to have my loins girt about and
     my lamp supplied with oil; so that, whenever the bridegroom
     is announced, I may be ready t  enter in.

     ‚ÄúI desire to be more spiritually minded; and to have more
     of a realizing faith, as to the truths I am exercised
     about day by day out of the holy word. I would fain see
     religion on the increase among us; and have more abundant
     fruit of the word. Oh! that the Spirit were poured upon
     Europeans and natives! Oh! that the kingdom of Christ were
     established in my own heart! more settled in my family; my
     flock; and on all around generally. Oh! that the salvation
     were come out of Zion. Then should this nation be glad and
     rejoice; and He whose name is Jehovah, be acknowledged
     throughout the land. Amen.‚Äù

The debility of which Mr. Corrie here complains had so increased,
that the medical men decided that it would not be safe for him to
remain in Calcutta during the hot weather; and moreover, advised a
long sea-voyage as the best means for recruiting his impaired health.
He did not, however, think a voyage to be of so much consequence;
yet early in February 1823 he quitted Calcutta, accompanied by his
family and Captain Stephen of the Engineers, and went t  reside on
the coast, near Juggernaut. For the first eight or nine weeks of his
residence at Pooree, Mr. Corrie‚Äôs health had been greatly restored;
but the anxiety and fatigue which he underwent in attending the
sick-bed of Captain Stephen, who died at Pooree on the 10th of May,
brought on a serious attack of fever. In this state he attended the
funeral of his deceased friend; but being too unwell to proceed
through the service, he was carried home in a state of the greatest
exhaustion. In the course of the day, however, Mr. Corrie revived
sufficiently to allow of his writing to Mr. Thomason, an account of
the last illness of Captain Stephen; after which the fever returned
with such violence that for several days the sufferer was scarcely
sensible. The following is his letter:--


                       TO THE REV. T. THOMASON.

                                           ‚ÄúPooree, May 10, 1823.

     ‚ÄúThe last sad offices having been performed for your
     beloved son-in-law, I will endeavour t  recal some of
     the pleasing expressions which fell from his lips during
     the last week, both with a view to the comfort of his
     friends, and to indulge myself on a subject which engrosses
     all my thoughts. My acquaintance with the dear departed
     commenced in September 1814, when I saw him almost the
     whole of every day during about a week. Again in 1817
     and 1818, our intercourse was renewed both at Ghazeepoor
     and Benares. He was then, it is almost needless to say,
     strictly correct in his conversation and general conduct,
     but did not exhibit that serious impression of divine truth
     which latterly appeared in him. When we went on board the
     schooner, I soon discovered a marked difference in him
     in that respect. There was an evident love of religious
     exercises, and religious books; and I observed more than
     once a serious attention to private devotion. From that
     period our intercourse was unreserved, and his general
     conversation and remarks, such as belong to godliness.
     He joined us regularly in our morning and evening family
     worship. He frequently spoke of his expectation that his
     illness would end in death, but we hoped otherwise; and
     nothing particular, as to his views in the prospect of
     such an event was mentioned. He had never been free from
     bowel-complaint since we came together, and during the
     early part of the week commencing April 27, he complained
     of an increase to his disorder from having taken cold,
     though no such appearances as usually attend a cold
     appeared about him. He kept up as usual till Friday the 2nd
     of May, when he did not come to breakfast with the family,
     but came out to dinner.

     ‚ÄúOn Saturday he did not leave his room. On Sunday I went
     into his room, and asked if I should join him in reading
     the word of God and prayer, since he no longer could join
     with us. To this he gladly assented, and began to speak
     of the great mercy of God towards him in preserving him
     from acute pain, whilst he felt himself sinking gradually.
     I read the first lesson for the day, and he made several
     remarks on the applicableness of the admonitions to the
     spiritual state of the Christian. Being drowsy, from the
     opiates administered to allay his disease, he desired me
     to defer praying till the afternoon. In the afternoon he
     was quite awake, spoke of the mercies of God toward him,
     complaining also of his want of gratitude to his God and
     Saviour. I spoke to him of what I thought of his state
     when at Ghazeepoor in 1814, and especially some remarks
     he then made on hymn singing, and expressed my delight at
     his now altered feeling, and the ground of encouragement
     it afforded him. He said that he had strong convictions of
     sin before that time; that he owed much to his deceased
     Aunt Stephen, who had tried much to impress his mind with
     a sense of religion; adding, ‚ÄòI know now why Christians
     take so much pleasure in hymn-singing; they love to dwell
     upon the ideas conveyed by the words.‚Äô I may here observe
     that he several times, since we have been at Pooree,
     spoke of his Aunt Stephen, and of all his family, and the
     obligations he owed her.

     ‚ÄúTo-day he also mentioned his wish to partake of the Lord‚Äôs
     Supper, before his intellects should become clouded.
     On Monday, May 5th, he asked me if I were prepared to
     administer to him the Lord‚Äôs Supper. As no time had
     been mentioned the day before, I proposed to put off
     the celebration till next day, when we would make it a
     family ordinance; to this he cheerfully assented. I do not
     recollect any particulars of what fell from him that day,
     but his conversation was always with reference to his dying
     soon, and filled with thanksgiving to his God and Saviour
     for the comparative ease in which he lay, and especially
     for the hope of heaven which he enjoyed; often exclaiming
     that it was all of mercy, and entirely flowing from the
     Saviour‚Äôs merits. On Tuesday May 6, his mind was confused
     all the morning from opiates; about two, P. M. seeing him
     collected, I asked if he would now have the Sacrament
     administered? He said he wished to be more awake and would
     postpone it till the morrow; adding, ‚ÄòI have committed my
     all into the hands of my blessed Saviour, and I can trust
     him to keep me sleeping or waking.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúOn Wednesday he was taken up with some temporal matters,
     and wrote the letter which I forwarded to you on that day.
     Afterwards Mrs. Corrie and I went into his room, and we
     all, I trust, by faith fed on Christ in our hearts, with
     thanksgiving. Our sick brother was much alive during the
     whole of the service, and read the passages in which the
     congregation join, with much clearness and fervor. On going
     into his room about an hour after the service, he broke
     out, ‚ÄòOh, may this dispensation be blessed to my dear
     Esther, that she may give herself wholly up to God, and
     fix all her love on him alone. She has a deep sense of her
     own unworthiness, and I bless God for the piety that is in
     her.‚Äô On Thursday May 8th, there appeared no alteration in
     the state of his disease. Two surgeons from Cuttack having
     arrived, our own doctor brought them to see him. They went
     into the next room to communicate their thoughts on his
     case, when he heard them agree that nothing could be done
     for his relief. On my going into his room after they went
     away, he seized my hand with all his remaining strength,
     and said, ‚ÄòOh my dear friend, how much am I indebted to
     God for placing me at this time with friends, who do all
     they can for my comfort, without concealing their concern
     that my soul should be prepared for death;‚Äô adding much on
     the evil too many medical men are guilty of in cherishing
     hopes of life when their patients should rather be thinking
     of death, and contrasting the difference of his present
     circumstances with what they would have been had he gone,
     on leaving Calcutta, among strangers and irreligious
     persons; then adding praise and thanksgiving to God. On
     the early part of this afternoon Mrs. Corrie went into
     his room, when he presently began to speak to her as for
     the last time, praying that her husband might be spared
     to her, and her children, and to the church, adding many
     expressions of his regard and affection.

     ‚ÄúOn Friday, May 9th. On my entering his room early, and
     enquiring after his state, he said, ‚ÄòI have had a wretched
     night, not in body, for I have been easy, but in mind. I
     have been thinking of this and that treatment which might
     have been used; but it is all wrong, and thus my wickedness
     brings its own punishment. I have much tried to repent of
     my daily wickedness, and of my wicked life.‚Äô Adding a good
     deal on the subject of God‚Äôs ordering all our affairs, and
     the duty of looking above human agents--and said, ‚ÄòO never
     did weary traveller desire his home more than I desire my
     rest:‚Äô most cordially acknowledging with me the duty of
     submission, and joining in prayer for an increase in faith
     and patience. Some favourable symptoms appeared, but he
     seemed to build nothing on them. For several days we had an
     European Sergeant to sit up at night. He has expressed his
     surprise at the constant patience our brother manifested,
     and told me, that he was much in prayer during Friday night.

     ‚ÄúOn Saturday morning, about half past three, a violent
     discharge of blood took place, and again about five. I
     went into his room just after the latter, and found him
     prostrate indeed.

     ‚ÄúHe began at once, ‚ÄòO my God, suffer me not to fall from
     thee: make my repentance sincere, and let my faith stand
     firm--O! accept me, unworthy! for the merits of Jesus
     Christ. I am wretched and miserable, let my soul be
     cleansed in his blood and presented spotless before thee;
     bless my dear wife and children, bless my dear father and
     mother, bless you (addressing himself to me,) and your
     family; and God make you a greater blessing than ever to
     the church, but don‚Äôt waste your life in this country,
     go home and do good among the poor. O God! bless all the
     doctors who have attended me, and let them not forget
     their own mortality amidst these scenes;‚Äô adding prayers
     for such generally as he might at any time have had
     disagreement with. On my reminding him of our blessedness
     in having an advocate with the Father to render these
     petitions available, he added strong expressions of the
     mercy of God towards him, and of his earnest desire to be
     at rest with God; adding ‚ÄòO God, thou knowest that I love
     thee,‚Äô and asked me if I thought it wrong to pray for his
     dismissal. He spoke of his temporal affairs as settled, and
     said he had no anxiety about his children, the Lord would
     provide for them. About 7, on going into his room, I spoke
     respecting the little probability when we first met that
     I should survive him: he began to pray for blessings for
     me, adding, ‚ÄòBless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all
     his benefits; who forgiveth all thy sins, who healeth all
     thy diseases.‚Äô Adding with emphasis, ‚Äò_forget not all his
     benefits_; that he had been forgetful all his days, but the
     Lord had shewed him great mercy.‚Äô From that time he spoke
     little. Being removed to another bed, he dosed much from
     medicine. About ten, observing him restless, I asked if he
     wanted anything? he said ‚ÄòNo.‚Äô If he retained his peace of
     mind? He said, ‚ÄòHis mind had become very confused.‚Äô And on
     reminding him of the ‚ÄòAdvocate with the Father,‚Äô he faintly
     added, ‚ÄòBless God for all the way He has led me,‚Äô or to
     that effect. About eleven, seeing him restless, and less
     of consciousness about him, I asked him if he knew me, he
     said, ‚ÄòYes;‚Äô and in answer to my question, ‚ÄòIf I should
     pray for him?‚Äô he said, ‚ÄòYes;‚Äô but there was no respond
     to the few petitions I offered up, and he was no longer
     sensible. At half-past one, another discharge of blood took
     place, which led us to think him expiring; but the spirit
     lingered till half-past two, when, we doubt not, he entered
     into his much-desired rest. I may tell you, though I mean
     to send a medical statement of the fact, that the three
     doctors ascertained after his death, that the liver was
     perfectly sound, but the colon had become ulcerated; and at
     length, a blood-vessel being eaten through, the discharge
     above-mentioned ensued, and brought on dissolution; but
     that this must have happened at no great distance of
     time, and that no change of climate or treatment, could
     have prevented the fatal result. This morning the beloved
     remains were committed to their parent earth, in the Pooree
     burying-ground. The burying-ground is an enclosed square on
     the sands of Juggernauth.

     ‚ÄúThose sands, after almost a year from the Rutt Jattra,
     are still strewed with the whitened bones of the
     wretched victims of this Indian Moloch, and I indulged
     the idea, whilst standing by the grave, that we were
     taking possession of the land in the name of Jesus our
     Lord. Without disparagement to a few other remains there
     interred, and of whose history I know nothing, I _knew_
     that we were committing to the earth the remains of a
     member of His mystical body; and will He not bring in the
     remnant of His elect, and shall not these, at present,
     wretched Hindoos, bow to His sceptre, and confess Him
     ‚ÄòLord, to the glory of God the Father?‚Äô Then, instead of
     that heartless brutality with which idolatrous remains are
     treated, decent burial will be given them; and instead of
     the howling of jackalls and wild dogs over their remains,
     ‚ÄòDevout men will make lamentation,‚Äô though they will
     not sorrow as ‚Äòthose who have no hope.‚Äô These remarks,
     dearest brother, are indulged in, rather to ease my own
     heart, than to comfort you and your sorrowing family. I am
     inexpressibly afflicted for this my brother, but what is my
     grief compared with his family‚Äôs? I send off this blotted
     and only copy, both that you may receive it within a due
     time of your knowledge of the afflicting event; and that
     no discretion may remain with me as to multiplying copies.
     Mrs. Corrie joins me in tender sympathy to all your house.‚Äù

For the remaining portion of the month of May, Mr. Corrie continued
to gain no strength. A change of air was, therefore recommended, and
he removed to Cuttack, about fifty miles inland. There it pleased
God to recover him surprisingly fast. But in a letter to Mr. Sherer,
dated June 13, 1823, he observed:--

     ‚ÄúBy the frequent attacks of illness I have of late
     experienced, our thoughts are sometimes directed towards
     you [in England]; but I must remain another year in order
     to the pension. The Lord only knows what time may bring
     forth. I feel most reluctant to leave India, and nothing
     but necessity shall lead me to leave it at present.‚Äù

Ten days later Mr. Corrie writes to his brother:

                                 ‚ÄúCuttack, Orissa, June 23, 1823.

     ‚ÄúYou will have heard the reason for my being here, so I
     will not repeat the history of my ailment. I am, through
     Divine mercy, much better, but this enfeebling climate is
     not favourable to the recovery of strength, especially
     at the age of forty-six. You accuse me of writing
     despondingly, I am not aware of any such feeling; though
     sickness induces reflection, and ‚Äòit is a serious thing to
     die.‚Äô Although my faith in the Redeemer is unshaken, and
     affords at times strong consolation, yet the presence of
     sin often clouds the view. But I will not fill my paper
     with such reflections.

     ‚ÄúOn the death of the Archdeacon about two months after that
     of the Bishop, Parson and I were appointed Ecclesiastical
     Commissioners. The Archdeacon of Bombay remonstrated
     against our appointment, and some of the Chaplains have
     acted without reference to us. We have gone on quietly;
     as in fact, there is little for us to do officially; and
     I should not wonder to see in some of the high church
     Reviews, (if opportunity offer) accusations of neglect. The
     fact is, the Bishop has no authority whatever beyond what
     his personal character may procure him. The late Bishop
     laboured all his Indian life, to establish an authority
     independent of the local Government. This was resisted
     covertly by the Government, and was felt to be a grievance
     by the Chaplains. I rejoice greatly in Mr. Heber‚Äôs
     appointment, and trust it is a token for good to the
     established church in India. Nothing short of annihilation
     as a society, will be refused him by the Church Missionary
     Society in Calcutta; and in truth, everything short of a
     separate existence for it, was repeatedly offered to the
     late Bishop.

     ‚ÄúI should not have entered on this subject, except to tell
     you how in the providence of God, I have been affected by
     events.‚Äù

During Mr. Corrie‚Äôs absence from the Presidency, the Rev. Isaac
Wilson arrived from England, and the Calcutta corresponding Committee
of the Church Missionary Society having thus obtained the aid of a
clergyman, whom they could appoint as secretary, decided on forming
a Church Missionary Association, as had been done at Madras. Up to
this time, it will be remembered, the concerns of the Society for
Missions to Africa and the East, had been conducted in Bengal by a
Committee appointed originally from England; so that although the
friends of religion had by this arrangement possessed the means of
substantially contributing to the support of Missions, yet they had
    been formally embodied in a Society. The jealousy and opposition
of Government to Missionary operations having now, however, somewhat
abated, it was thought important to take advantage of the first
favourable opportunity that presented itself, to place the Church
Missionary Society on a more definite footing. The arrival in India
of an episcopally ordained Missionary, who could render essential aid
to an object that appeared so desirable, decided the corresponding
Committee to take measures for the formation of an Association so
soon as ever Mr. Corrie should return to the Presidency. This he was
enabled to do during the month of July, and accordingly on the 31st
of that month, the best means for forming such an Association were
taken   to consideration. On the 11th of August another meeting of
the corresponding Committee and their friends was held, at which
rules for the conducting of a Church Missionary Association were
provisionally agreed upon; and with a view to a public meeting
towards the end of the month, copies of the proceedings of the
Committee were in the meantime printed and circulated for the
information of the subscribers to Church Missions in Bengal. On the
28th of August a public meeting was held, and the Calcutta Church
Missionary Association was formed, Mr. Corrie being chosen the first
President. In the Report of the proceedings on the latter occasion,
it is stated that

     ‚ÄúThe Rev. D. Corrie, in accepting the office of President
     of the Association, addressed the meeting in a speech
     which breathed an ardent spirit of piety, of affection,
     and of zeal for the sacred cause of Missions. It would be
     impossible to convey any adequate idea of i  by a cursory
     mention    this place of the persuasive topics then so
     feelingly urged. Suffice it, therefore, to say, that, as
     Mr. Corrie himself was deeply affected, so he made a deep
     impression upon the whole audience.‚Äù

The formation of this Association was not, however, effected without
some little opposition, but as that appears to have arisen from a
misunderstanding of the motives and relative positions of the parties
concerned, and was speedily allayed, it is therefore here mentioned
merely in deference to the truth of history.

Respecting his own affairs Mr. Corrie wrote to Mr. Sherer, then in
England:--

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, Sep. 11, 1823.

     ‚ÄúWe are all, through mercy, quite well. We canno  be so
     much alone as my state of body requires, but we are more
     alone than when you were here, and our souls and bodies
     benefit by it; though I canno  but regret the partial
     exclusion it occasions from some of the excellent of the
     earth.

     ‚ÄúOf public affairs I can say nothing, except that a
     Committee for public Instruction  s formed. This was
     planned under Mr. Adam‚Äôs reign. A picture of him was voted
     after Lord Amherst‚Äôs arrival, by a great meeting at the
     Town-hall. Mr. A. is gone to Bombay in very bad health.

     ‚ÄúOur great man, the Bishop, will soon, we hope, be here. He
     will come opportunely for our Missionary affairs, and his
     coming will prove, we trust, a blessing to many. They say
     he means to make the senior Chaplain Archdeacon; whether
     that means Mr. Shepherd, or myself, I know not, and am not
     anxious about it. I should lose in point of emolument, but
     the ease would suit me in my present state of health. I
     trust I can bless God for an   creasing indifference as to
     outward things and distinctions.

     ‚ÄúMr. Jetter, about a fortnight s  ce, baptized a young
     Brahmin; and inquirers increase at Mirzapore. The place
     is becoming known. It is now, also, assuming a pleasing
     appearance.‚Äù

According to expectation, Bishop Heber reached India at the beginning
of Oct. 1823. So soon as ever it was known that the Bishop had
reached Saugur, Mr. Corrie, as senior chaplain, Mr. Abbott as
registrar of the diocese, and Principal Mill of Bishop‚Äôs College,
went down the river in the government yacht, to conduct his lordship
to Calcutta. On Saturday, Oct. 18th, the Bishop was installed in
the Cathedral, and on the following Monday was pleased to appoint
Mr. Corrie to the Archdeaconry of Calcutta. With reference to that
circumstance Bishop Heber wrote to Mr. Williams Wynn.[114]

     ‚ÄúI have bestowed the Archdeaconry, much to my satisfaction,
     on the senior resident chaplain, Mr. Corrie, who is
     extremely popular in the place, and one of the most amiable
     and gentlemanly men in manners and temper, I ever met with.‚Äù

In a letter from Dum Dum, Nov. 3, 1823, announcing his appointment
to the Archdeaconry, Mr. Corrie also informs Mr. Sherer:--

     ‚ÄúWe are miserably off for Chaplains, and you will see from
     the date that I am at Dum Dum doing duty there until we
     get a reinforcement. I am, however, but weak, being on the
     recovery from a fever which was brought on by going out in
     the heat, to marry a couple about the middle of October.
     I had become quite unfit for the Presidency duties. The
     sight of the Cathedral used to make me ill, from the weak
     state into which I had fallen; and I trembled like a leaf
     in the breeze when I ascended the steps of either desk or
     pulpit. At the same time I could not leave the country, not
     being entitled to the pension, for a year to come. I am now
     relieved from those distressing occasions, and my mind is
     eased of a burden. I feel that, humanly speaking, I may yet
     be strong here, and do a little in the Missionary cause.‚Äù

Nor were these Mr. Corrie‚Äôs anticipations with respect to his health
premature; for being now released from the duties of the Cathedral,
he gradually recovered his strength, and attained to such a
healthiness of appearance, that persons who had not seen him for some
time, could scarcely imagine that he had been so seriously ill.

But besides the beneficial change which had thus been effected in
Archdeacon Corrie‚Äôs personal condition, it was no small satisfaction
to him to find, that in carrying on the affairs of the Church
Missionary Society, he could now have the advantage of the support
and direction of his Diocesan. For the difficulties in the way of
co-operating with that society, which appeared insuperable to the
late Bishop Middleton, having been either surmounted or removed,
i  became the pleasant duty of the Archdeacon, to propose that the
Bishop of Calcutta should be respectfully requested to accept the
office of President of the Auxiliary Church Missionary Society,
which was formed in that city, on the 1st of December 1823. Nor,
after the active part which he had taken in the proceedings of the
Society, could it be otherwise than gratifying to the Archdeacon, to
hear Bishop Heber, on that occasion, publicly express his lordship‚Äôs
conviction, that the Church Missionary Society, in conjunction with
others of a similar nature, had been the means of accomplishing
extensive good.

For the two months following the occasion here referred to,
Archdeacon Corrie was chiefly resident at Dum Dum. To his brother he
writes from

                                       ‚ÄúCalcutta, March 11, 1824.

     ‚ÄúOur hot season has commenced. During the cold season
     we have been residing chiefly at Dum Dum, the Artillery
     station, seven miles from the fort, where, s  ce my
     preferment, I have done the Chaplain‚Äôs duty. Mr. Crauford,
     now Chaplain of the Old Church, having friends in the
     Artillery regiment, with whom he spends some days every
     week, has agreed to take the duties of Dum Dum for the
     present, leaving to me the charge of the old church. In
     this Mr. Wilson, a Church Missionary, assists me; so that
     I have had, as yet, no relief, except from the occasional
     duties of this large place. And indeed, this was all I
     desired, as, when not exposed to the sun and consequent
     fatigue, I am as well as I am likely, with my nervous
     frame, to be anywhere. We must now consider ourselves fixed
     here for seven years, should life be prolonged. What may
     be necessary for our children in that period, we know not.
     Hitherto they have enjoyed good health; and if it please
     God to continue it to them, we do not mean to separate them
     from us. But we experience in fact, I trust, as well as in
     theory, our depende ce on a higher power, and are disposed
     to do what may be His holy will, as we discover it.

     ‚ÄúOf our public affairs you hear through public channels.
     Of private and family affairs I do not like to say much
     on paper. The bishop has proved toward myself most
     disinterested and kind. Had he been less impartial and
     less feeling than he is, I should not now have been here.
     Repeated attacks of fever had so weakened me, that I could
     not go through my duties; and here no unemployed clergyman
     is at hand to help a friend in need. I was therefore,
     preparing for a voyage to the Cape, which by draining our
     resources would both have kept us low in circumstances, and
     would have sent me back to what had proved a distressing
     situation. We cannot therefore, but feel the hand of
     Provide ce in the very considerate kindness of the Bishop.
     He has met with much annoyance, I fear, in consequence,
     from quarters where submission to Episcopal authority used
     to be the order of the day; but which, like all order not
     founded on Scripture principles, is only submitted to when
     on their own side. I do not say that Episcopacy is not
     founded on Scripture, but that, _all obedience_ to it does
     not rest on the same foundation. I can truly say, I never
     took a step in our Church Missionary proceedings which had
     not the sanction of episcopal principles.

     ‚ÄúWe have now three Missionaries from the Society for
     the Propagation of the Gospel. The College has begun
     operations, and I feel no little satisfaction that the
     first student is a youth previously prepared by the Church
     Missionary Society. He is given up to the Society for
     the Propagation of the Gospel, partly because they have
     funds unappropriated, and the Church Missionary Society
     has not, and partly because I could not find among our
     friends the support I wished for in respect of this youth.
     Alas! how much of human infirmity cleaves to us all; for
     I do not pretend to be free from it, and others see more,
     perhaps than I should like to acknowledge. Our Bishop is
     the most free from party-views of any man I ever met with.
     In a ruler this is beautiful, and I have felt the benefit
     resulting from it. But a few years ago it seemed as if it
     was impossible to exercise such a spirit. Certainly Bishop
     Heber in those days, would not have been raised to the
     Bench; when unlimited submission was the only condition of
     cooperation. Some would have given up the Church Missionary
     Society, and have resolved all the Episcopal Societies into
     the Diocesan Committee. I withstood it, and held what is
     now acknowledged, that the Bishop is (such) in his office
     alone, and that whenever he sits in committee, he sits as a
     private member, and not as Bishop. Hence he can sit in any
     Society conducted on episcopal principles. The time indeed
     seems approaching when all societies will send out men of a
     similar spirit, and then our co-operation will be complete.
     The three men, of the Society for the Propagation of the
     Gospel, appear truly pious, though as yet they manifest not
     that love of prayer and religious exercises which maintain
     religion in its power.

     ‚ÄúI long to hear more of you all, but we must be content, I
     believe, to endure this longing as a necessary concomitant
     of our voluntary banishment. I earnestly wish you would,
     as you have opportunity, direct the attention of young
     men of piety to this country. Of twenty-six Chaplains
     allowed for Bengal, only thirteen are present; the distress
     consequently is great, especially in Calcutta. No one of
     us can be ill, or omit a sermon, without casting additional
     labour on men already fully employed, whilst the Dissenters
     are in number strong; both exhibiting variety to draw
     people, and relieving each other from too much work.

     ‚ÄúOur Government has declared war against the king of
     Burmah, and an expedition is ordered against that country.
     We have had skirmishing already on the borders, and have
     lost some officers. Happily there is no power in the
     interior to disturb us at present. Runjeet Sing, the king
     of Lahore, is moving on the banks of the Indus; and it is
     said an army of observation is forming on the Bombay side,
     to watch him. We are all well, and expecting a journey
     through the Upper Provinces in company with the Bishop and
     family, to comme ce in June.‚Äù

Before the time arrived for undertaking the journey here mentioned
as in prospect, Archdeacon Corrie was called upon to officiate at
the ordination of Christian David, a native of Malabar. This person
had been a pupil of Schwartz, and had for many years been employed
as a catechist in Ceylon, by the Society for promoting Christian
knowledge. He had proved himself to be so faithful a labourer, in
the Christian cause, that except for some legal scruple on the part
of Bishop Middleton, he would have received ordination from that
prelate in 1821. He now came to Calcutta, bringing with him the
recomme dation of Archdeacon Twistleton, and for a title, a colonial
chaplaincy to which he had been appointed by Sir Edward Barnes, the
Governor of Ceylon. The day fixed upon by Bishop Heber, for the
ordination of Christian David, was Ascension-day (May 27, 1824,)
and on the following Trinity Sunday, he was ordained priest. With
reference to that most interesting event, Archdeacon Corrie wrote


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, June 10, 1824.

     ‚ÄúI had to examine him on such points as a missionary to the
     heathen, unacquainted with Western science should know.
     The Bishop was so pleased with my questions and Christian
     David‚Äôs answers, that he has sent a copy of them to the
     Archbishop of Canterbury.‚Äù

After some observations on private matters, the Archdeacon then adds:

     ‚ÄúAll public religious affairs you will learn from the
     Missionary Register. A Ladies‚Äô Society for promoting native
     female education; Lady Amherst, Patroness!![115] Who would
     have dreamt of this a few years ago?

     ‚ÄúWe set out next week with the Bishop, but a difficulty has
     arisen about my being absent at the same time [with him] I
     being _ex officio_ Commissary. This will in all probability
     bring us back from Chunar. I have got over the hot season
     without a fever, and am now tolerably well, though
     constrained to keep in doors. I look forward to coming to
     England as a dream of which the reality is barely probable.
     O, may we be more in the contemplation of our heavenly
     home! I have no reason to be dissatisfied with the world,
     further than as sin renders it uneasy to me, sometimes me
     to it; and my children will perhaps be better off by my
     remaining here. For the rest, I have but little anxiety;
     and home is home, in a Christian, as well as in a worldly
     sense; nor shall we be at home until we get to heaven.‚Äù

The difficulty referred to in the foregoing letter, as regarded the
absence of both Bishop and Archdeacon from Calcutta at the same time,
having been surmounted, Bishop Heber, accompanied by his Chaplain,
Mr. Stowe, comme ced his journey toward the upper provinces on the
15th of June, 1824. Archdeacon Corrie, with his wife and children,
followed in a separate budgerow. After three days voyage on the
river, they parted company; the Bishop and his chaplain proceeding to
Dacca, whilst the Archdeacon and his family passed on by Berhampore,
and Malda, to Bhaugulpore, where they were to wait for the Bishop.
But in the meantime Mr. Stowe was taken dangerously ill at Dacca,
and died there on the 17th of July.[116] Bishop Heber joined the
Archdeacon‚Äôs party on the 10th of August, and proceeded to visit the
several stations of Monghyr, Patna, Dinapore, Buxar, Benares, Chunar,
&c., in succession.[117] When, near Allahabad, the Archdeacon wrote
to his brother:--

                                                 ‚ÄúSept. 12, 1824.

     ‚ÄúWe have seen much done here in the way of preparation; but
     then it is much only as compared with the former state of
     things. With reference to what remains to be done, nothing
     comparatively has been accomplished. The country near
     Allahabad, which the English possessed when I arrived in
     Bengal, extended in length about twelve hundred miles, by
     an average breadth of one hundred and fifty or two hundred.
     That constituted the Bengal Presidency. The Ganges may be
     considered a line running through the length of the tract,
     dividing it into two parts. Throughout this extent, there
     was only one place of Protestant worship [and that] in
     Calcutta; and not a _building_ appropriated to worship out
     of Calcutta, belonging to the English. There are now in
     Calcutta four places of worship in the Established Church;
     besides the Mission College, and three Dissenting Chapels.
     There is a Church at Dacca, Benares, Chunar, Futtyghur,
     and Meerut. Churches are in the course of erection at Agra
     and Cawnpore. Whilst at the old stations of Dinapore and
     Berhampore, public worship is still performed in an empty
     barrack. There are at Monghyr and Benares, dissenting
     Chapels, and perhaps at some of the upper stations also.
     All this has not been accomplished without considerable
     individual exertion, as well as public support: and
     though individual piety is still lamentably scarce, yet
     much more of public attention to religious observances
     prevails than formerly; and also much more of individual
     piety. With respect to the natives, when I arrived in the
     country, a few converts were found at Serampore; and a
     few, I believe existed at Dinapore: nor were there any
     attempts [to convert the natives] entered upon beyond
     those places, except at Cutwa, where the late missionary,
     Chamberlain,[118] had settled. Now, we have a few native
     converts in Calcutta, at Burdwan, and at Cutwa and its
     branch in Beerbhoom; at Monghyr, Buxar, Benares, Chunar
     and Meerut. In each of these places, a few converts are
     found; and what will eventually work greatly for the good
     of the heathen, some of the Roman Catholic converts, and
     descendants of Europeans, who had become quite native in
     their habits and language, are attracted by the labours of
     the missionaries at those places; and in some of them, as
     at Chunar, where the native congregation is the largest
     on the side of India, [the Roman Catholics] constitute
     the chief part. Besides these, I might mention Meerut,
     and Futtyghur, where missionaries are labouring, and some
     converts have been gained. Thus where all was darkness,
     now, here and there, a glimmering of light begins to
     appear. But a reference to the situation of these places
     on a map, and of the small number to whom the means of
     grace have proved effectual at each place, will shew you
     how little has yet been accomplished. How much remains
     to be done, ere this people can possess even the means
     of knowing the way of life! We are now, as you know,
     attending the Bishop. His visit cannot fail to increase
     the disposition of the British to help on the work of
     missions. At Buxar, he sat down in the hut of the native
     catechist, and heard the Christians read; and questioned
     them in their catechisms; at Benares, he went in his robes
     to the Hindoostanee chapel, where Mr. Morris officiates,
     and pronounced the blessing; and the same at Chunar. He
     has acquired sufficient Hindoostanee to give the blessing
     in that language. Also at Benares, he administered
     Confirmation to fourteen native Christians, and afterwards
     the Lord‚Äôs Supper: and at Chunar to fifty-seven native
     Christians. He asked the questions and pronounced the
     prayer, in Confirmation, in Hindoostanee, and also the
     words addressed in giving the elements in the Lord‚Äôs
     Supper. In the latter ordinance, he was assisted at Benares
     by Mr. Morris; and at Chunar by myself. But, in general, I
     have not been able to do more than attend him in public;
     my state of weakness not allowing of visiting or dining
     from home. Some of the old alarmists still remain, who,
     by these proceedings, are silenced if not convinced; and
     scoffers are put to shame. The Bishop, also, visits all
     the missionary native schools, as he proceeds; and the
     Missionaries are greatly encouraged by the interest he
     takes in their proceedings.‚Äù

The Archdeacon then adds:--

     ‚ÄúI must say a few words about myself. The season has not
     been favourable, as yet, for restoring my strength. We
     have had comparatively little rain; and the east wind
     failed by the 20th of August. Since then the west-wind has
     blown: and now in the afternoon blows hot. The river is
     fallen as much as is usual in November. Notwithstanding,
     I am greatly stronger than when in Calcutta, and have no
     positive disease: at least I think so. We now begin to feel
     the coolness at night--the forerunner of the cool season.
     Six weeks will bring it here. I then hope, with care, to
     recruit, and feel much the goodness of God in allowing me
     this hope.‚Äù

On the 27th of November 1824, Archdeacon Corrie addressed the
following letter to Mr. Buckworth, from Cawnpore:--

     ‚ÄúYou will have heard, from my friends, of the debilitating
     effects this climate has at length began to have on my
     frame; but I am thankful to be able to say, that I am
     better this year than last. Knowing the cooler nature of
     this part of the country, at this season [of the year,]
     the Bishop kindly invited me to accompany him [on his
     visitation], and here we arrived early in October. The
     latitude is five degrees higher [North] than that of
     Calcutta; and, being within two hundred miles of the Snowy
     Mountains, is more than proportionably cooler. Your parish
     news is very interesting to me; and the increase of your
     places of worship must be a source of great gratification
     to you. If it should be given me to be your helper in one
     of these Churches, separate from occasional duties, some
     day, it would, I trust, be a comfort to both of us. But
     it becomes us more than ever not to boast, or lay plans
     respecting the morrow. We have now passed a fair proportion
     of the days usually assigned to man; and besides this, we
     have both personal experience of a dying nature. I feel
     for my own part, how sickness even may lose the effect of
     impressing the idea of death; and have hourly need to pray
     for more of that quickening Spirit, who alone makes us and
     keeps us alive to God and things divine and eternal. Our
     situation here is quite different from yours,--we have no
     parish annals to record. I arrived at this [station] on the
     day fourteen years after sainted Martyn had dedicated the
     Church. The house he occupied stands close by. The view of
     the place, and the remembrance of what had passed, greatly
     affected me. I arrived on the Sunday morning, after divine
     service had begun; (the Bishop having come on the day
     before) and, as the Chaplain is sick, I had to assist in
     administering the Sacrament; and well it was, on the whole,
     that none present could enter into my feelings, or I should
     have been overcome.

     ‚ÄúYou wish to hear tidings of our Bishop; and, from public
     sources, you will have heard of the favour he shews
     generally to the righteous cause. Of the natural amiability
     of the man, it is impossible to convey an adequate idea.
     Our children speak of him always as ‚Äòthe dear Bishop.‚Äô
     I merely mention this to shew how lovely he appears in
     his general temper and habits. His conversation is very
     lively; and from his large acquaintance with books and
     men, very instructive, and tending to improve those he
     meets with; whilst he industriously seeks opportunities of
     public worship, Sunday and week day; and urges on all the
     importance of attending on the means of grace. Surely this
     land has cause of praise to God, that such an one has been
     placed at the head of affairs here!

     ‚ÄúAt this station, there are about two thousand five hundred
     Christians, and the chaplain being sick I remained here,
     to do the parochial duties. Having accompanied the Bishop
     to Lucknow, where we were entertained by the King of
     Oude, I returned hither. The Bishop presented the King
     with a Bible, and a Book of Common Prayer, in the native
     language; and the King was so taken with the Bishop, that
     he begged to have his picture; which was accordingly
     taken immediately, by an eminent English artist, whom the
     King keeps in constant pay. The Bishop went on his way to
     Meerut, Delhi, and Agra; at the latter place I hope to meet
     him, about Christmas; I am now therefore in a sphere I
     greatly like. On Sunday last I had two full services; and
     attended a meeting with the Dragoon regiment on Wednesday,
     and with the Foot regiment last night, and feel no ill
     effects; by which you will judge of the bodily strength
     which is mercifully renewed to me. I have one of the
     learned native converts with me; and he is collecting the
     few native Christians here, and we shall, I hope, be useful
     to them also.‚Äù

          CAWNPORE--CALCUTTA--RETURN OF MR. THOMASON--DEATH
                           OF BISHOP HEBER.


It was because Archdeacon Corrie did not find himself equal to the
fatigue of travelling, that when the party reached Lucknow, it was
decided, that instead of proceeding with the Bishop, he should
endeavour to recruit his strength by remaining stationary for a time
at Cawnpore. From that place, therefore, he writes


                      TO THE REV. MR. THOMASON.

                                        ‚ÄúCawnpore, Dec. 26, 1824.

     ‚ÄúI have been expecting, for some time, to receive a few
     copies of the last Report of our Calcutta Church Missionary
     Society. I am very desirous of endeavouring to help the
     funds; but cannot well make applications without giving
     some information as to our plans. I begin to fear that
     even if about eight copies were dispatched immediately,
     they would not reach me in time, as I am only waiting the
     Bishop‚Äôs decision as to my movements. I have now done
     the duty here, for five Sundays, and expect to be here
     about three Sundays more. I could much have wished Mr.
     Torriano[119] to have arrived before I leave, but he will
     find his way comparatively smooth. You know I brought
     Fuez Messeeh with me from Benares, where he was doing
     little, and had fallen ill. He is still prevented by the
     cough, which has for some time affected him, from doing
     all I believe he is willing to do for the gospel. I have
     every reason to believe him to be a partaker of Divine
     grace; though his talent in communicating what he knows to
     others, is not great. He, on our arrival, brought a few of
     the families of the Christian drummers and fifers to our
     house, for Sunday worship; and about six of their girls are
     learning to read Hindoostanee and to sew, with Mrs. Corrie.
     About three weeks ago, Mr. Fisher, Peter Dilsooke and his
     wife Ruth, with their two sons came here. They had a chit
     [letter] from Mr. Fisher, and I have since written to him,
     and ascertained that he thinks well of them as Christians.
     I have retained him on ten rupees a month, to teach such
     Christians [adults] as wish to learn to read the Scriptures
     in their native tongue, and Nagree character, and he has a
     school in the lines, of eight adults; and his wife teaches
     the Christian girls in our house, their two boys go to the
     Free School. There are three native corps here generally.
     The Christians connected with them are not fewer than sixty
     or seventy; and there are many of a similar class connected
     with the many public offices of the field command,
     besides a considerable number of poor people of the same
     description, who resort to Cawnpore, as the Calcutta of the
     Upper Provinces. The native population too, is wonderfully
     increased since I was resident here. On the whole, this
     place calls loudly for Missionary help; and I greatly hope
     something may be done, at least for those who profess
     Christianity, and understand only the native language.
     Already our congregation on Sunday last had increased to
     about twenty; and I am writing to Chunar for copies of the
     native catechism, and Nagree hymns, which are much desired
     by some of the Christians. I happily got a supply of the
     Scriptures in various languages. Should the Bishop decide
     on my residing in the Upper Provinces, these stores will
     prove invaluable; and become the means of blessing, I hope,
     to many. The duties of a Chaplain, I know from experience,
     leave him, at such stations as this, little leisure for
     extra-parochial engagements. As I shall have more leisure
     for such pursuits, with liberty to remove from place to
     place, I shall consider it a peculiar happiness to be the
     means of establishing christian worship, for the class of
     people who are to be found at every station professing
     Christianity, and knowing only the native language.

     ‚ÄúI believe no copies of the ‚ÄòOutline of Ancient
     History,‚Äô[120] have been sent to Bombay; will you be so
     good as to send twelve or twenty copies to Mr. Farish,
     as a specimen, that more may be sent if required? The
     first class of native youths, in the Free School here,
     are reading it; and get, from the former chapters of the
     work, such information on the early religious history
     of the world, as they would not otherwise at present
     obtain. This Free School will, I hope, prove very useful
     to this part of the country. There are ten boys and ten
     girls already on the foundation, on the plan of the
     Calcutta Free School. Many poor Christian day-scholars,
     and seventeen natives, are learning English. There are
     also, belonging to the Institution, a Persian and Hindee
     school, containing together about one hundred children; who
     read only the School-book Society‚Äôs books. The young man
     who is schoolmaster, is a conscientious man, and attends
     diligently to the duties of the school. The divisions you
     have heard of nearly annihilated the school for a time; and
     an opposition school was opened for day-scholars. This will
     eventually do no harm. Competition will produce exertion,
     and education will be better forwarded. It is wonderful
     how much a little superintendence may help on these things,
     where there is no selfish end in view, and no seeking
     of preeminence; and I cannot but hope Mr. Torriano will
     prove a great blessing to this place. How would it have
     rejoiced the heart of Martyn, could he have had the chief
     authorities associated by order of Government, to assist
     him in the work of education; and how gladly would he have
     made himself their servant in the work, for Jesus‚Äô sake!
     One poor blind man, who lived in an outhouse of Martyn‚Äôs,
     and received a small monthly sum from him, often comes to
     our house; and affords a mournful pleasure in reminding me
     of some little occurrence of those times. A wealthy native
     too, who lived next door to us, and who was intimate with
     Sabat and Abdool Messeeh, sent his nephew to me, a few days
     ago, to make ‚ÄòSalaam;‚Äô and to express to me the pleasure
     he derived from his acquaintance with Martyn. These are
     all the traces I have found of that ‚Äòexcellent one of the
     earth,‚Äô at the station.‚Äù

The Archdeacon remained still another month at Cawnpore, and then
proceeded toward the valley of the Dhoon,[121] with the intention of
spending the hot season there. He writes to his sister, in a letter
dated

                                                  ‚ÄúMarch 6, 1825.

     ‚ÄúWe left Cawnpore on January 24; were one Sunday
     at Futtyghur, and two at Meerut, and are to-day at
     Muzuffernugur, three marches N. W. of Meerut, and in sight
     of the snowy mountains. At Futtyghur we met dear old
     Abdool, who is grown remarkably larger, but is reduced
     in strength. At Meerut we enjoyed the society of several
     excellent persons. Mr. Fisher has regular service in a
     fine church, on the plan of the cathedral in Calcutta, on      Wednesdays and Fridays, besides the morning and evening
     service on Sundays.... I was much pleased with what I saw
     of Mr. F., and his labours are blessed.

     ‚ÄúWe are proceeding to the Dhoon, a valley on the first
     range of hills. We expect to reach the Ghaut[122] in five
     days, and to be at Dehrah, the head station on the Dhoon,
     by next Sunday. We have in company with us, a son of
     Mr. Layard of Uffington,[123] who has suffered from the
     climate, although he has been only a year in the country;
     but will, I hope, recover among the hills, as he has no
     symptoms of serious illness about him. I am, through great
     mercy, quite well. I do not expect, indeed, that my nerves,
     never strong, will be ever what they were; still I am well,
     have recovered my former appearance and size, and have
     nothing to complain of.

     ‚ÄúI have daily more cause for thankfulness in my present
     appointment. Being confined to no station, I can go
     generally where I am likely to be most useful; and retreat,
     as we are now doing, from the violence of the hot winds.
     The country acquired by the Nepaul war is likely to be of
     great service as a retreat for invalids from the burning
     plains. There is a mountain near Dehrah in the Dhoon, which
     can be climbed with some difficulty, and has a fine level
     top where we can pitch our tent, and have the thermometer
     at 60¬∞ during the month of May. There we expect to pass
     the months of April and May, and to descend when the rains
     threaten; and so return to the plains. Farther on, the
     climate is equally favourable; with a greater range to roam
     over; but we are content to take the nearest shelter, as I
     have no desire after field sports, and we are happy enough
     at home. We have one of the Agra youths, named Amannee,
     with us, so that we make a congregation of six, and enjoy
     the repose of the sabbath much. We have a couple of small
     camel-trunks filled with books, and so carry with us food
     for the mind as well as the body.... Thus you know all our
     affairs. Surrounded by temporal mercies, I trust we are
     still saying, ‚ÄòWhom have we in heaven but Thee, and there
     is none on earth, &c. &c.‚Äô‚Äù

To his brother, the Archdeacon writes:--

                                   ‚ÄúDehrah Dhoon, March 30, 1825.

     ‚ÄúI am so much recruited in strength as to indulge the
     hope of some further years of further endeavour for the
     good of India. You hear of our public affairs from public
     sources, but there are certain discouragements in the
     situation of affairs, both as it respects church and state,
     which you will not hear, and which it is scarcely worth
     while to fill one‚Äôs paper with. He ‚Äòwhose kingdom ruleth
     over all,‚Äô is engaged to make ‚Äòall things work together
     for good to them that love Him,‚Äô and with His love in
     our hearts what need disquiet us?... Our difficulties in      church-matters arise chiefly from want of cordial union,
     and from the fluctuating nature of our Society, which
     renders it ne   sary to begin our affairs anew every few
     years; and causes     labour of communicating intelligence
     to be continually recurring. But the church generally is, I
     doubt not, advancing among us; and we must not grow weary;
     however, of ne   sity, we grow less able to do what we
     would. In our Bishop we have all we can have in one man, to
     unite us and to help our work by its various instruments.

     ‚ÄúYou would be delighted if you could visit us in our
     present situation. We are living on the ridge of Kalunga
     hill, near where General Gillespie fell ten years ago.[124]
     The house we occupy is a kind of hunting bungalow, three
     miles from cantonments, belonging to the commanding
     officer here. Leopards in plenty live around us, and some
     of our workmen going a few days ago to drink water at a
     pool, in a recess in t   wood, spied a large tiger on the
     opposite side. We, however, have nothing to fear from them;
     and now the novelty is over, the day passes in our usual
     studies and pursuits, very happily. The children and I ride
     on ponies, through the path-ways, early in the morning;
     with a few men with large sticks ahead, to frighten away
     any thing that might come among us. We have had snow on
     the neighbouring hill, within a week, and specks of it are
     still visible. We contemplate ascending the second range
     of hills, about 8,000 feet above those we now are on; and
     to pitch our tent there, during the approaching months of
     April and May, where the thermometer ranges, we are told,
     between 60¬∞ and 70¬∞. Here we are happy to have it, from
     twelve o‚Äôclock to six, about 80¬∞.... Even this is a relief
     unspeakable from the plains, and our nights are cool; the
     wind regularly setting-in, in the evening, from the snowy
     mountains. I have nothing to say about this people, (who
     differ a good deal from the people of the plains,) because
     I know but little about them.‚Äù

In another letter to his brother, dated 6th of April, Archdeacon
Corrie observes:--

     ‚ÄúI have told G. that our Bishop confirmed about 150 adult
     natives, at the different Church Mi sionary stations
     between this and Calcutta; which shows that we labour not
     in vain. The progress, though slow, is still a progress,
     in respect of the diffusion of Divine truth, in these
     parts. It will be an especial care to establish seminaries,
     at the principal stations, for the instruction of native      christian youths, on as permanent a footing as we can.
     Our territories, in this part of the world, are beginning
     to be too extensive. We can scarcely hope to have men, at
     the head of affairs, always of capacity enough for such
     a load of government; but He who ruleth over all, will
     doubtless use us for some good purpose, to this benighted
     land. May those of us who feel the importance of this
     subject be up and doing! There is a general falling off
     amongst the Hindoos, from their former system. They have no
     reverence for the usual forms of an oath. They set little
     by the Brahmins generally; and, except on festivals, and
     at particularly celebrated places, their idolatrous rites
     are fallen into considerable disuse. The Hindoos, too,
     much more generally than formerly, keep the Mahomedan
     festivals. These facts are noticed by all the men in
     office, throughout the country. From this, however, no good
     has, as yet, arisen, to the righteous cause. Though l  s
     observant of their own rites, they know nothing of the
     gospel that they should value it. Their festivals resemble
     an English fair, much more than what we consider by the
     word ‚Äòworship;‚Äô and it is not to be wondered at, that the
     natural man loves these occasions; or that a people so
     circumstanced, should at first turn away from the humbling,
     self-denying truths of the gospel, when set before them.

     ‚ÄúThese regions, [    Dhoon] are becoming much resorted to
     at this season by the British, on account of the cooln  s
     of the climate. I have a christian youth with me, whom I
     daily instruct, and we met here a Brahmin, who has been
     baptized by one of the Baptist Mi sionaries. H  would not
     stay with his teacher, having been long used to a roving
     life. He seems quite convinced of the supreme importance of
     Christianity. He reads the scriptures with me; and I hope
     may grow in knowledge, and in grace.‚Äù

To Mr. Sherer, who had just arrived in Calcutta from England, in
company with the Rev. Francis Goode, one of the Company‚Äôs Chaplains,
the Archdeacon writes:--

                                                   ‚ÄúMay 25, 1825.

     ‚ÄúThe arrival of Mr. Goode, after some recent comers, is a
     source of much thanksgiving. I can now say, as far as the
     church in India is concerned, ‚ÄòLord! now lettest thou thy
     servant depart, either to some retreat for a time on earth,
     or to the rest which remaineth!‚Äô I speak only in respect of
     the prospects of the church at this Presidency, which, from
     the several valuable ministers she now possesses, may well
     do without so bruised a reed as I am.

     ‚ÄúMr. Newton,[125] you will know, is now the financial
     secretary of our Church Mi sionary Society. He, above all
     our Committee, has been with me like-minded, entering
     with all his spirit into our concerns, and looking our
     difficulties in the face. Having, as I hope, got Mirzapore
     into some form, we must go on cautiously; by which I mean,
     have our resources in view before we extend our plans. I am
     now anxious to get the Female Central School built, and to
     extend no more, but rather contract the present scale of
     small schools.‚Äù

It will have been seen that it was in Bishop Heber‚Äôs contemplation,
that the Archdeacon should permanently reside in the Upper Provinces,
that by this means more effectual a sistance might be rendered to
the Bishop in administering the affairs of his vast diocese. It was
however, ultimately arranged that whilst Bishop Heber was visiting
Madras and Bombay, the Archdeacon should proceed to Calcutta. With
this object in view, Archdeacon Corrie l ft the Dhoon, in the
beginning of June, for Meerut. From that place he wrote


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                  ‚ÄúJune 25, 1825.

     ‚ÄúWe have been here (as you will have heard through Mrs.
     Ellerton) a week. I feel some comfort in the idea of being
     a hundred miles nearer to you, but here, I apprehend, we
     must stay a month at l ast. The season has been unusually
     warm here. For several years past, the seasons have proved
     irregular, but this year the regular hot winds have been
     blowing, and the natives anticipate a plentiful production
     of the fruits of the earth. We are tied in the meantime;
     and on every account I must not expose myself [to the heat]
     more than I can help. We are at present in a bungalow which
     Parson and his family inhabited most of the time they were
     at Meerut. It is in Mr. Fisher‚Äôs compound; and here, I
     believe, we must stay, for no other place is to be found.
     An additional regiment of Cavalry and one of Infantry, are
     to be here, so that every corner is filled. We have been
     living with the Fishers almost entirely, but have now got
     their leave to supply ourselves in this bungalow.

     ‚ÄúMr. F. is more attended to than any chaplain in the
     country, by the upper cla ses, as well as by the lower; and
     has a wide correspondence among conductors, writers, &c. at
     surrounding stations. H  has also a native congregation.
     This is doubtless his proper work. A missionary, however,
     would not at all interfere with any thing doing here. It
     is evidently of God alone, that the few natives prof  sing
     christianity have been drawn together and kept together.
     Many are reported as prepared for the reception of
     christianity at Delhi, and Mr. H. Fisher yesterday went to
     reside there, with Anund Musseeh. Anund has been unwell
     with the small-pox, and unable to attend Mr. Fisher, for
     scriptural instruction, as the Bishop desired; so that
     his ordination must be postponed until some more distant
     period. I am anxious to hear from the Church Mi sionary
     Committee respecting Abdool and Bowley, in answer to my
     letter of the 14th of April. If I hear nothing I shall
     bring them down, considering the Bishop‚Äôs wishes sufficient
     authority.‚Äù

To the same relative, the Archdeacon again wrote

                                                  ‚ÄúJuly 23, 1825.

     ‚ÄúWe purpose leaving this [Meerut] at the end of August,
     and shall get down to you speedily. I told you that the
     heat affected me, but by keeping quiet, I have avoided
     feeling more than languor. I have not yet called on any,
     except one or two in the next premises around us. I have
     always assisted Mr. Fisher; and kept his flock together
     during twelve days he was absent at Lehornupore and
     Deyrah, where his son John is. H  and his son Samuel had a
     narrow escape from drowning, on their return. One of the
     mountain-torrents came down suddenly. A _Suwarr_,[126] who
     was with them, escaped with difficulty, together with his
     horse. Samuel‚Äôs horse was carried down a good way, but both
     his and Mr. Fisher‚Äôs horse, being in better heart than the
     Suwarr‚Äôs horse, got over. A pedestrian, who attempted to
     swim over, was drowned.

     ‚ÄúWe have now the rains, but scantily. The natives begin to
     say the rains will not be heavy this year.‚Äù

In accordance with the purpose expressed in the foregoing letter,
Archdeacon Corrie l ft Meerut on the 22nd of August. In a letter
addressed to Mr. Sherer, on the 25th of that month, the Archdeacon
remarks:--

     ‚ÄúWe l ft much good at Meerut, and pa sed our time
     pl asantly; and, I hope, not unprofitably.... We are in
     sight of Futtyghur, from whence I shall dispatch this.
     Goodness and mercy continue to attend us. The weather is
     unusually favourable for us, but the country requires rain.

     ‚ÄúAt Meerut we had a Bible Society Sermon on the 14th, and
     a public meeting on the 16th. Considerable interest, above
     former years, was excited, and a fair collection made. Some
     converts to the cause, also, among the upper cla ses of
     Society.‚Äù

On his way to the Presidency, Archdeacon Corrie visited Cawnpore,
Chunar, Benares, and other stations with which he had      before
time connected or acquainted. With regard to Cawnpore, he obser    in
a letter to Mr. Sherer, dated

                                      ‚ÄúAllahabad, Sep. 12, 1825.‚Äù

     ‚ÄúI wrote to Mr. Thomason, from Cawnpore, about a native
     chapel. I am happy to tell you that little, if anything,
     will be needed from the [Church Mi sionary] Society to
     accomplish this object. I put a paper into circulation
     before I l ft, and there was enough for present purposes
     being raised at the station.

     ‚ÄúOn the Sunday, which I pa sed at Chunar, about two
     hundred attended Divine ser ice, of whom about forty were
     unbaptized inhabitants of the place, and most of whom
     attend every sabbath-day. Some of the scholars who have
     recei    instruction in English, afford the most pl asing
     hopes of their sincere conversion.‚Äù

And in a letter to the same relative, he writes from

                                         ‚ÄúBenares, Sep. 26, 1825.

     ‚ÄúWe are detained here longer than I wished, but I hope to
     do something for the mission by the delay. Our friends are
     each doing what he can in his sphere. They have suggested
     that I should write a letter to the Committee, which might
     be printed in the Monthly Intelligence, giving some account
     of the schools and congregations. I will send such a
     letter, and it may be printed or not.‚Äù

With reference also to this subject, the Archdeacon informs his
brother in a letter dated

                                   ‚ÄúOct. 11, 1825, above Monghyr.

     ‚ÄúMr. H. Fisher, at Delhi--his father at Meerut: Mr.
     Torriano, at Cawnpore--have each a native missionary
     who labours around them, and instructs especially those
     natives who profess christianity. This last cla s is fast
     improving, I would fain hope, in knowledg  and character;
     and thus they become ‚ÄòEpistles of Christ, read and known‚Äô
     among the heathens: and the reproach which formerly
     attended the gospel is lessening.‚Äù

Thus wherever the Archdeacon might be, the subject nearest his heart
was, the progress of the gospel among the heathen.

It was on the 25th of October 1825, that Archdeacon Corrie arrived
in Calcutta, on his return from the Upper Provinces. Among the first
things to which the Archdeacon directed his attention, were the
affairs of the Church Mi sionary Society, which he found to be as
prosperous as could well be expected. At the end of the following
month he was gladdened by the ordination of his long-tried friend
Abdool Messeeh, who, together with Messrs Reichardt and Bowley, was
admitted into the order of Deacons, by Bishop Heber. The ordination
took place on the 30th of November, in the Cathedral of Calcutta,
and in the presence of a larg  congregation, among whom were more
than twenty clergymen. It was remarked by one who was present on that
interesting occasion, that

     ‚ÄúNothing could equal the joy of Mr. Corrie: he appeared
     as if he could just then adopt the languag  of Simeon of
     old. He has watched the gradual progress of every thing:
     he could remember when matters assumed a far different
     semblance.‚Äù

On the 23rd of December the Archdeacon attended the Bishop at a
public examination of the children educated in the schools maintained
in the Calcutta Ladies‚Äô Society for Native Female Education; when,
during the examination, the Rajah Boidenauth came forward and
presented the Society with a donation of 20,000 sicca rupees, toward
the erection of a central school. One of the great objects which the
Archdeacon had long had in view, was thus in the progress of being
realized; and as a preliminary m asure, he obtained permission to
place under the Ladies‚Äô Society, those Female-schools at Burdwan
which had hitherto been supported by the Church Mi sionary Society.

These several causes for rejoicing were not, however, without a
corresponding draw-back. The hot season of 1825 had      unusually
unhealthy, and among others who had suffered in health were Mr. and
Mrs. Thomason, especially the latter. This decided Mr. Thomason
to return to Europe early in the spring of 1826. Mr. Sherer, too,
having accomplished the object for which he went out to India, was
preparing to return to his family in England. The Bishop, moreover,
l ft Calcutta on the 30th of January 1826, for the purpose of holding
visitations in Madras. Under these circumstances Archdeacon Corrie
writes to Mr. Sherer, then on the point of embarking for England:--

                                                  ‚ÄúFeb. 22, 1826.

     ‚ÄúA feeling of desolation oppresses me, which I try to shake
     off, by looking to Him who possesses all fulness, in order
     to supply his needy dependents. In P. I lost my worldly
     adviser, and in Mr. Thomason my religious helper: but the
     Lord liveth. In you, I will not say how much we seem to
     have lost; but this much I cannot but say. There is no
     possibility of my following you in less than five years,
     and what may occur before then, who can tell? It would be
     presumptuous to say any of us shall see that period; and
     yet there is no doubt a secret hope that we shall. How I
     shall part with the mother and the children, I know not. It
     seems as if they ought sooner to go into a more favourable
     climate, and if it were necessary, I suppose the necessity
     would go far to reconcile me to it. My heart goes with you
     to Morcott and Colsterworth; may you b  carried to them in
     health and safety, and may the peace of God attend your
     meeting with them! It seems superfluous to say anything
     about my love for them. They need no assurance of it; yet
     it is a relief to write about it.‚Äù

Some further account of his condition is given by the Archdeacon


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                 ‚ÄúMarch 14, 1826,

     ‚ÄúW  continue much as you l ft us. The wet has set in, and
     the monsoon has been almost constantly against you. The
     Bishop was twenty days reaching Madras. This will delay
     your progress; but great is our happiness in knowing that
     winds and waves obey His will, ‚Äúwhose we are, and whom we
     serve.‚Äù

     ‚ÄúOur Friday evening [services] have been but irregularly
     attended. The Government dinners have, no doubt,
     interfered; and next Friday Lady A. has an ‚Äòat home.‚Äô
     Shall we ever have ‚Äòthe powers that be‚Äô on our side? Yea,
     doubtless, it shall be even so.

     ‚ÄúYou will know all about Lord A‚Äôs recal before this reaches
     you. May it pl ase God to send us a Governor who will at
     l ast own his duty in respect of the God of Christians!
     The most painful thing in the present administration is,
     that our duty as Christians is not recognised. Policy is
     avowedly the idol worshipped.

     ‚ÄúI am thankful and happy in my present situation. I know
     not what time, if permitted to me, may bring forth, but
     I cannot at present conceive of happiness in leaving my
     station. A few short years will unite us all, I trust,
     where probably natural feeling will be absorbed in
     relationship to Christ, but not, I apprehend, be forgotten.
     In the mean time, while passing through this ‚Äòvalley
     of Baca,‚Äô let our correspondence serve as ‚Äòpools of
     refreshment.‚Äô‚Äù


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

                                       ‚ÄúCalcutta, April 11, 1826.

     ‚ÄúBefore this reaches you, we hope you will have received
     back our dear Sherer, well in all respects. In this
     changing world, we know not what a day may bring forth, but
     we are taught that ‚Äúsuffi   nt unto the day is the evil
     thereof;‚Äù and, therefore, I will anticipate none of those
     things, evil to nature, to which both he on the water and
     his family on land are liable, but trust that your meeting
     has been joyous and thankful. W  go on much as Sherer l ft
     us. The fall of Bhurtpore and peace with Ava,[127] leave
     the country externally quiet, but in so extended an empire,
     composed of such discordant elements, we are less, in
     reality, settled. Two native regiments at Bhurtpore refused
     to go into the trenches; the business was hushed up, but
     a discovery was made of the state of the native mind. The
     fact is, that ‚Äòthe powers which be,‚Äô while they fear the
     smallest movement in favour of Christianity, fear nothing
     when saving money is concerned. Whereas the native, if he
     be liberally dealt with, will give you his caste even, if
     you do not demand it all at once. ‚ÄúThe Lord reigneth,‚Äù must
     be our motto; and though w  cannot but see what is doing,
     must refer ourselves, to His power, providence and grace,
     to order all things as shall be for His own glory.

     ‚ÄúYesterday I completed forty-nine years. Great goodness
     have I experienced, great ingratitude am I conscious of;
     but great is the mercy of God my Saviour; infinite the
     value of Jesus‚Äô blood. Therefore I will hope on, and expect
     to b  preserved by ‚Äúthe power of God through faith unto
     salvation.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe restoreth my soul for his name‚Äôs sake.‚Äù

Within a few days of the date of the foregoing letter, Archdeacon
Corrie received the afflicting intelligence that it had pl ased God
suddenly to remove Bishop Heber from this scene of trial, to the
church triumphant in heaven. Appended to a copy of the letter from
the Rev. Mr. Doran which announced this event, and the circumstances
by which it was accompanied, the Archdeacon wrote


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                       ‚ÄúCalcutta, April 15, 1826.

     ‚ÄúBy the copy on the other side you will see with what a
     heavy stroke God has smitten us; doubtless in mercy, though
     we see it not now. Nothing can be added at present to Mr.
     Doran‚Äôs account. All here is mute astonishment. Public
     and individual concern is spread over all. I will send
     all the public documents, and will take the first further
     opportunity to send more particulars.‚Äù

These particulars are too well known to need repetition in this
place, but the following extract from a letter addressed about that
time by the Archdeacon to his brother, may not be without interest:--

     ‚ÄúYou will hear from other sources of the loss all India
     has sustained, in the death of Bishop Heber. My first
     impression was to inform Sherer, who, from being so lately
     among us, could judge more readily of our feelings on the
     occasion. I have printed, and privately distributed, a
     sermon preached at the time; and have sent some copies
     to Mr. P   t. Mr. Robinson [subsequently archdeacon of
     Madras,] took some copies to send home, with a sermon
     of his own, preached at Trichinopoly, the Sunday after
     the Bishop‚Äôs death. W  cannot but be anxious as to who
     will succeed to this see. Our late beloved Bishop was so
     entirely a Missionary, that we can scarcely hope to see one
     like him; and in respect of temper and beauty of general
     disposition, to expect the like of him seems utterly
     hopeless. In what I have said of him in the sermon, I have
     said what I know his views were on certain points, rather
     than expressed my own. Such was the natural amiability of
     Bishop Heber‚Äôs character, that it was often diffi ult to
     say whether he acted from nature or grace. But whatever
     might be judged by some, at times, to be errors of
     judgment, the general tenor of his life was so opposed to
     worldly maxims, and what the world would have wished him
     to follow, that there seems no doubt grace was the ruling
     influence of his conduct. The great number of subscribers
     he obtained for the society for the Propagation of the
     Gospel, shews what an influence he had obtained; and how
     many he had drawn over to support the Missionary cause.‚Äù

The sermon here alluded to, was preached in the Cathedral Church
of Calcutta, on Sunday, April 23, from Heb. xiii. 7, 8. In a short
notice prefixed to the sermon, the reason for printing it is stated
to be ‚Äúnot any idea of its pretensions to literary merit, but a
sincere desire on the part of the author, to improve the melancholy
occasion of it, to the good of a community with which he had been
connected nearly twenty years.‚Äù The Archdeacon added, that as ‚Äúall
who approached their late beloved and venerated diocesan, could not
but admire his brilliant conversation, various acquirements, and
commanding talents, it was hoped that, the perusal of the sermon
might tend to recommend, to some at least, the cultivation of those
principles of Christian piety which spread a charm over all his other
great qualities.‚Äù

The limits within which it is desirable to comprise these memoirs, do
not allow of the insertion here of the vivid sketch of Bishop Heber‚Äôs
ministerial life in India, which this sermon contains, but as, in
the letter quoted above, specifi  reference is made to the Bishop‚Äôs
‚Äúviews on certain points,‚Äù it may be proper to quote the outline of
the doctrines which the Archdeacon states himself to have ‚Äúheard the
deceased prelate preach,‚Äù on different occasions.

     ‚ÄúIt was the _word of God_ which he administered. For man,
     fallen from God and far from original righteousness,
     he preached a full and free redemption by the blood of
     Christ--justifi ation by faith--the need of the Holy
     Spirit‚Äôs grace to incline and enable man to repent, and
     to bring forth fruit meet for repentance, persuading
     man, by the terrors of the Lord, to flee from the wrath
     to come, and by the mercies of Christ, to be reconciled
     unto God--the pleasantness of religious ways--the comfort
     attending the death of the righteous--the terrors of a
     judgment-day to the impenitent, and the rewards of the
     faithful servant--setting forth every Christian duty in
     its relation to Christian principle, in his own peculiarly
     lively and impressive manner.‚Äù

It is scarcely necessary to add, that Archdeacon Corrie was among
those who met in the Town-hall of Calcutta, on the 6th of May,
for the purpose of expressing their deep concern at the loss which
India had sustained in the death of Bishop Heber, and for devising
means by which the memory of the labours of that man of God might be
transmitted to future generations.[128]

On the 18th of May, the Archdeacon, after having long desired to see
such an object accomplished, was called upon to take part in the
ceremonial of laying the foundation-stone of a Central School for
the education of native females. Four years, it will be remembered,
had now elapsed since female education in India had been first
commenced on a general plan; but the diffi ulties in the way of
such an undertaking were apparently so serious, that but few could
have ventured even to hope that such an inroad on Hindoo prejudice
and superstition could have been made, as that above five hundred
females should already have been brought under instruction in
Calcutta and the vicinity alone. The ground purchased for the site of
the school and other requisite buildings, was in the centre of the
Hindoo population, and about half a mile to the north of the Church
Missionary station at Mirzapore. The foundation stone was laid by the
Lady Amherst, prayer having been offered up by the Archdeacon for the
divine blessing on the undertaking. Many natives (particularly women
and their daughters) were present, on this interesting occasion;
and the Rajah Boidinath Roy, through an interpreter, congratulated
the Lady Amherst on the success which had crowned the exertions
of her Ladyship and the Ladies of Calcutta; expressing also, his
deep sense of the gratitude which himself and others entertained
for the benefits which might be expected from the education of his
country-women.

The demise of the Bishop devolved on the Archdeacon the
administration of the affairs of the diocese during the vacancy of
the See. In writing to his brother he therefore observed:--

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, June 29, 1826.

     ‚ÄúWe are now residing in the Episcopal house, which
     Government allows me to use, as Commissary for the See,
     and gives me the Bishop‚Äôs salary instead of my own. It is
     a new thing to me, to be consulting Burn‚Äôs Ecclesiastical
     law, Gibson, &c. There is, indeed, no power vested in the
     Bishop of Calcutta, for Government reserve the decision of
     every point to themselves; and the letters patent give no
     independent authority. Yet such a man as Bishop Heber will
     be applied to from all parts of India, on points affecting
     divorce, wills, &c., and his opinion will be received as
     law: so that such studies as I have mentioned, are not in
     vain. The love for antiquity, indeed, which some entertain,
     overlooks, I think, too much the present race of men; and
     sooner than deviate from ancient modes, would suffer them
     to pass out of life in their ignorance; but I have as yet
     discovered no ground for such rigid adherence to rules
     adapted to the Church in a settled state, and am sure the
     early Evangelists did not observe them.

     ‚ÄúAll things here begin to assume their usual appearance
     again, except that our beloved Bishop no more occupies his
     seat among us; and that a second Escutcheon, hung up in the
     Cathedral, reminds us, that two Bishops have passed away
     from among us. My mind seems wearied with considering what
     may be destined for our Indian Church. The work of Missions
     had assumed a regular form. In the south of India, regular
     help, and enough of it, would give Christianity an almost
     established form; so many Natives profess Christianity. May
     God be gracious unto the land, and send us a man of a right
     spirit!‚Äù

By the advice of the medical men in Calcutta, the Archdeacon decided
on a journey up the river, as for as Benares and Chunar. He,
therefore, left Calcutta in the month of July 1826, visiting several
of the out-stations as he passed along. On reaching Benares, one
of the chief objects of his attention naturally was Joy Narain‚Äôs
school, in the founding of which the Archdeacon had taken so much
interest. He had now the satisfaction to find the School in excellent
order; there being in it one hundred and thirty-one boys under daily
instruction. Besides this, he found that two youths who had been
educated in the school, had been engaged ever since January last, as
assistant English-teachers in the free-school at Cawnpore, and were
giving satisfaction; and that the success of those youths in thus
obtaining a comfortable provision for themselves, had recommended
the school to the good opinion of the natives of Benares and the
neighbourhood. The Archdeacon found, also, that six other schools
had been established, in different parts of the city, in which, among
other books, the gospels were read. With reference to these schools
he observes:

     ‚ÄúThe streets of Benares, being for the most part very
     narrow, the boys assemble in long Verandahs, and the
     passers-by see and hear all that takes place. This, though
     unfavourable for the purposes of a School, yet causes what
     the boys read to be heard by many; and sometimes a hundred
     people, and upwards, will crowd around, while the boys are
     examined, in the previous week‚Äôs Exercises: and thus their
     knowledge is diffused.‚Äù

On reaching Chunar, the Archdeacon records in a memorandum dated--

                                          ‚ÄúChunar, Sep. 17, 1826.

     ‚ÄúIt is twenty years since I reached Bengal, having
     arrived in Calcutta on Saturday, Sept. 20, 1806. I had
     appointed the 20th. Sept. as a day for calling my ways
     to remembrance; but have aforetime too much neglected
     this duty: and I fear interruption on Wednesday, the
     Anniversary of my actual entrance on life in this land.
     Many sinful causes have of late years, prevented me from
     making Memoranda of the state of my mind, as formerly, but
     I have thus deprived myself of the power of calling many
     things to mind, of which I ought deeply to repent; and am
     constrained to pray, ‚ÄúCleanse me from my secret faults,‚Äù
     secret and hidden by forgetfulness from myself. Early in
     1819, I arrived at the highest emoluments in the way of
     Chaplains. In 1822, I received increased emoluments as
     a Commissary for the See; and now enjoy alone, all the
     advantages arising from the second vacancy of the See. I
     feel decidedly, and painfully, that large means have not
     been of advantage to myself, or family. My own soul has
     gradually lost much of the liveliness I once possessed
     in religion. The readiness to labour, the willingness to
     attend to the poor, the pleasure of going here and there to
     serve others, either officially or of choice, is greatly
     departed from me. Increased years, and debility, may have a
     share in this indisposition to active duties, but are far
     from being the whole cause. I am deeply conscious, also,
     that the receiving of so many [persons] from time to time
     into our house (though in many cases a mere returning of
     civilities, or rather favours previously by us received,
     and a debt of gratitude, and in almost every case appearing
     to be an exercise of hospitality) yet the numbers at table,
     consequent desultory conversation, &c. weaken the power of
     religion in me, and I seem to myself to have no strength
     in comparison of former days. I have many thoughts how far
     this company and constantly full table have had a share
     in my loss of health. I would especially call to mind, my
     dulness in secret duties, and how seldom I can ‚Äòtake hold
     on God.‚Äô I read and kneel in devotion, but too generally
     without apprehending or appropriating any benefit. Deeply
     humiliating as this is, I yet bless my Saviour that it
     is no worse; that He has not cast me utterly from his
     presence, nor taken His Holy Spirit from me. I am conscious
     of a desire to be ‚Äòas in days past,‚Äô and of some endeavour
     after it. But O! I have much ground to regain; many days
     to redeem, and fewer left to work out my salvation in.
     The cross of Christ is my only hope and glory. The Lord,
     I think, knows I desire to be crucified with Christ; and
     to have all iniquity taken away. Lord, work thou in me to
     do, no less than to will! Oh! incline and enable my dear
     partner to bear in mind more and more, the subjects of our
     late conversations; that our own souls and our lovely and
     beloved children, may be improved in every grace of the
     Spirit; and that our l   t may yet shine before men, to the
     glory of our heavenly Father. Preserve our dear children in
     health; and O! give them spiritual healing and blessing.
     Make us more and more one in Christ Jesus. Help me to walk
     circumspectly, and to behave in present circumstances as
     becometh the gospel of Christ. O keep me from any fall,
     either in public or private; and lead me in the paths of
     righteousness _for thy name‚Äôs sake_. Other plea have I
     none: other refuge have I none. To thee, to thee alone I
     cleave. A poor feeble vine, I would cleave to thee as the
     stem; and in thy strength alone be strong. Quicken me more
     and more. Lead me from strength to strength. ‚ÄòHold thou me
     up, so shall I be safe?‚Äô O! forsake not the work of thine
     own hands. I am thine, save me. Amen.‚Äù

As it was at Chunar that Archdeacon Corrie commenced his missionary
labours, his account of the state of the native church there may not
be omitted. He writes:--

     ‚ÄúThe congregation of the Hindoostanee worshippers, is
     rather on the increase. The day I was there, upwards of two
     hundred attended, of whom at least fifty were unbaptized
     natives. I conversed with some of the recent converts, who
     appear to be really sincere. Among them some are natives of
     villages in the neighbourhood, who, at first, were greatly
     opposed by their relatives; but retreating to Chunar, they
     continued to receive renewed strength and encouragement,
     by attending on the means of grace. By repeating their
     visits home at intervals, they have at length overcome
     prejudice so far, as to be heard with attention, on the
     subject of their change; and in one case, the convert (who
     is one of several brothers, Brahmins, who are the principal
     cultivators in the village) has been acknowledged by his
     family, and allowed to resume his place among them.

     ‚ÄúOf those natives who attend Christian worship, one whole
     family have become candidates for baptism. The first of the
     family who became impressed with the subject of religion,
     was the eldest son; about two years ago, he proposed
     himself for baptism, but his father entreated Mr. Bowley
     to delay, and he also would consider whether he should not
     join the son. Mr. Bowley on this account recommended delay
     to the son; he has continued steady, and now the father and
     mother, and some other members of the family, are resolved
     to embrace Christianity.‚Äù

On the 20th of September the Archdeacon commenced his journey back to
Calcutta. When above Rajemahl, he wrote


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                   ‚ÄúOct. 4, 1826.

     ‚ÄúAt Benares and Chunar, our friends are greatly improved,
     and their usefulness and comforts increased by the
     ordination. There is also more of Christian union and
     love among them, and their work prospers. We call on the
     chaplains and missionaries as we pass along, and on few
     besides. We hope to reach the Berhampore river to-day. We
     have been mercifully preserved, during our journey on this
     uncertain river. By going leisurely, we have not had an
     alarm, while most persons we have met with have lost boats,
     or been some way annoyed. What lies before me I know not. I
     regret not having regularly to preach, for though ministers
     are too apt to read the Scriptures for others, I find it
     good in any way to be kept close to them.

     ‚ÄúI sometimes long to visit you all; but vain are such
     longings, for after all, we are only that to each other
     which God makes us. The l   t of His countenance alone,
     maketh whole; and I should have no comfort in leaving my
     post, without some more evident necessity than appears at
     present.‚Äù

Archdeacon Corrie arrived in Calcutta toward the end of October, and
early in the following month (Nov. 12th) was present at the opening
of a new chapel at Mirzapore, in which it was intended to have the
services of the Church of England statedly conducted in Bengalee.
Not long before Bishop Heber left Calcutta on his last visitation,
he had recommended the Church Missionary Society to make a pecuniary
grant toward the building of the chapel, and the Archdeacon had laid
the foundation-stone of it during the April of this year; the object
mainly contemplated in the erection of it being, to afford native
Christians and such natives as mig t be enquiring after Christianity,
an opportunity for attending the worship of God, conducted in their
own language. On this occasion, a considerable number of native
Christians were assembled within the chapel, and the doors were
thronged by crowds of Hindoos and Mahomedans, who were attracted to
the spot.

On the day following, the Archdeacon writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, Nov. 13, 1826.

     ‚ÄúFrom Sherer you will learn our own affairs, and will know
     that since he left us we have been up to Benares. We are
     rendered uncomfortable in this large house by the decaying
     state of some part of the walls; so that our personal
     comfort is not increased by the enlargement of our limits.
     And so I have found it in every advance in temporal
     circumstances; something or other connected with it, has
     always prevented increase of enjoyment. All true happiness
     dwells in the mind: and O, ‚ÄúWhat shall I render to the
     Lord,‚Äù that the peace of God, through Christ Jesus, is no
     stranger to my breast? Too often, alas, have I had reason
     to mourn my backslidings in heart, and temper, and conduct;
     but if guilt removed return, the power of the atonement
     may, also, be again and again proved.

     ‚ÄúI find myself more a bishop than during the former vacancy
     of this See; but here again the passings-by of some, the
     reluctance with which others apply for what they    not do
     without, &c. mig t well embitter this temporary elevation
     also; but that, I trust, I have learned to forbear in some
     measure, and to forgive as I expect forgiveness; so that
     no breach has occurred with any of our body. I am bound
     both in conscience and consistency to take part in those
     measures which have, all along, given offence to some,
     whilst they are obl  ed also to take me with them in their
     plans. The reluctance, however, is on their part, for ‚Äòso
     that Christ be preached, I rejoice.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúNow our cold season is set in, I think with reluctance, of
     returning to England. Here, I trust, I am useful in helping
     on projects for the good of many thousands; in England,
     a small parish would be all I could undertake the charge
     of. Nothing, therefore, but decided inability to remain
     in India should make me leave it. Our children, indeed,
     c  not here fully comprehend that flow of the Christian
     affections which the interest taken in all classes at home
     calls forth; and whether I shall be able to part with them
     and their mother, for three years, to visit England, I know
     not. I greatly shrink from such a separation.

     ‚ÄúYou will have read the life of Dr. E. D. Clarke, and will
     have seen the intense desire with which, when abroad, he
     sought letters from home. Now something similar has always
     dwelt in me, though wife and children, dear as life, have
     consoled me under long silence from home. The life of
     Clarke is admirably well done. I remember the person of the
     biographer, and admired his fine delivery of a sermon at
     St. Mary‚Äôs [Cambridge]; the subject of it I have forgotten.
     But that is a long time ago, he must be getting old now,
     and I am following fast after him.‚Äù

During this month (Nov.) it was, that a circumstance occurred of
some interest, as indicative of the feeling of the native mind,
with regard to Christianity. It appeared that for want of funds,
the Committee of the Church Missionary Society in Calcutta, were
intending to withdraw their missionary from Culna, a populous town
and district on the west bank of the Hooghly, where schools had been
establ shed. But no sooner were the principal native inhabitants of
the place (who were chiefly of the Brahmin caste) apprised of that
intention, than they presented a petition in Bengalee, to Archdeacon
Corrie, requesting that the missionary mig t be continued with them.
Among other things, they observed that:--

     ‚ÄúThey acknowledged that they formerly entertained some
     slig t degree of apprehension of our sacred books; but that
     in consequence of the Rev. Mr. Deerr making known to them
     these our Scriptures, not only had their fears entirely
     vanished, but they considered that these books were
     deserving of unqualified reception, and hig ly beneficial;
     and on this account, they considered themselves equally
     benefitted, and rejoiced, as much as a man born blind when
     he receives his sig t.‚Äù

It having been decided to appoint an assistant to Mr. Bowley,
in the mission at Chunar, Mr. Landeman, who was born in India,
and well acquainted with Hindoostanee, was the person fixed
upon. Previously, however, to the departure of this gentleman
from Calcutta, a meeting was held (Dec. 15, 1826,) in the Church
Missionary Library, at Mirzapore, when Archdeacon Corrie delivered
an address to Mr. Landeman, in which he took a brief review of the
circumstances connected with the then state of missions, and the
duties arising out of them. The whole address was characterised by
that large-mindedness, singleness of heart, and tenderness, which the
Archdeacon was wont to manifest on occasions like these.[129]

As several months had now passed since the death of Bishop Heber, the
intell  ence of the appointment of his successor, was daily expected
to reach Calcutta. Thus the Archdeacon writes


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                     ‚ÄúCalcutta, January 25, 1827.

     ‚ÄúIt seems that the news of Bishop Heber‚Äôs death had reached
     England overland in August. ‚ÄòThe Osprey,‚Äô and ‚ÄòBarett,‚Äô
     c rry official accounts. We shall now soon hear of a
     successor. The head of the Church reigneth, let the earth
     rejoice; and may we wait the result in patience. You will
     hear that Mr. Mack publ shed, in the ‚ÄòMonthly Friend of
     India,‚Äô an attack on our Mirzapore friends; very unkind,
     and mistaken. It has recoiled painfully on their own head;
     for Adam, who is now editor of the Bengal Chronicle, has
     taken it up, and ‚ÄòJohn Bull,‚Äô has responded; and the old
     sores about Serampore premises, imperfect translations,
     and fallacious statements, have all been laid open again.
     We have kept silence, though called upon for explanations,
     &c. &c., and the storm is a little blown over.... The
     time of difficulty in our funds, (viz) the end of our
     year, has come on, and I am often much cast down in mind.
     Great temptations arise to withdraw, and leave things to
     themselves: for few come freely to take a part.... But
     is not the cause of missions the cause of Christ? I fear
     really for those, who, with the opportunities now afforded,
     c n overlook that cause. It seems pure self shness, to be
     content that these [natives] should go on in ignorance
     and sin, so we get but to heaven ourselves: and it is
     often, I doubt, fear for myself, rather than love for the
     heathen, that keeps me, in a measure, at the Missionary
     helm. But here I must stay: yet after all, if I wear away,
     some mig t feel it then incumbent on them to take it up
     more efficiently. Doubtless a principle is at work in this
     community, which will lead the population forward rapidly
     in knowledge and character generally; and if it be not
     rig tly directed, those who neglect the present season of
     operation will suffer: but I shall not see that time, rapid
     as the progress is. New states are plainly no place for a
     person who possesses a competency, and can enjoy repose.
     India especially, is not a country a man who knows anything
     of England would _choose_ to grow old in. Here, in a
     peculiar degree, the mind is forced to look off, both from
     the Church and from the world, to the Rock, Christ.‚Äù


                             TO THE SAME.

                                                  ‚ÄúFeb. 22, 1827.

     ‚ÄúWe are now more out of the way of such a bustle as we
     formerly were subject to, being, (as I think I told you)
     fixed in a nice little house at Cossipore; but I fear
     falling into the opposite extreme; for when we cease to
     do all we oug t for the good of our fellow-sinners, we
     sin against the law of Christ. Surely, there is as little
     peace in retiring, self sh ease, as in bustling ambitious
     publ city. I returned a few days since, from Burdwan.
     The fields indeed, in that quarter, seems ‚Äòwhite for the
     harvest,‚Äô but both Mr. Perowne, and Mr. Deerr, are obl  ed
     to leave their posts, and seek change of air. Mr. Bowley
     is, also, becoming well attended to, about Chunar. Isaiah
     lx. 4, 5.[130] has been much on my mind, as appl cable to
     these two spheres of M          labour at this time; and
     fear fills my heart, whilst it is enlarged with gratitude
     and thankfulness.

     ‚ÄúWhat may be the effect of such a commotion as seems
     approaching, on the powers that be, and how we shall
     provide for the increased calls for men and money, I know
     not. But surely He whom we serve in the gospel of His Son,
     c n, and will appear for us. Rumours have reached us about
     a new Bishop, and men unknown to missionary fame, have been
     named. This seems sad: let us in patience wait the event.

     ‚ÄúGovernment has given forty rupees monthly to Chunar
     Church; and the same to Gorrikepore Church: and I am not
     without hope of getting a monthly salary for Bowley, as
     Minister on the Establ shment, to a congregation of native
     Christian subjects of the Government. Yesterday was the
     Bible Society anniversary. An excellent report, drawn up
     by Mr. Goode: all our old plans are going on, sometimes
     briskly, sometimes heavily. ‚ÄòFaint, yet pursuing,‚Äô my
     habitual motto.‚Äù

In the following month, (March 15) Archdeacon Corrie again visited
Burdwan, for the purpose of examining the schools there, and also
for making enquiry into the conduct of the head Pundit connected
with the mission, who, for some time had been carrying on a system
of double-dealing. It appeared that this Pundit had induced no
less than thirteen Brahmins (most of them school-pundits) to apply
to the M          at Burdwan for Christian baptism; and that, as
a preliminary step, they had accordingly been receiving daily
instruction from the missionary, and evidencing the while a good deal
of apparent sincerity and earnestness. At length however, one of
the number went to the missionary, and told him, that all that had
occurred was mere hypocrisy, and had been kept up at the instigation
of the head-Pundit; that the only object they had in view, was to
induce, if they could, the missionary to ‚Äúreport them as enquirers
after truth;‚Äù their notion being, that if that were but once
publ shed, they would have the missionary in their power, as they
thoug t that, for consistency‚Äôs sake, he must keep up appearances,
and so be obl  ed to continue them in their schools, and pay them
their wages.

It has been thoug t desirable to mention the particulars of this
transaction, because a repetition of such or similar attempts to
deceive missionaries, may be expected to occur the more frequently,
in proportion as the profession of Christianity becomes more common
among the natives of India. It does not seem, however, that the
Christian m          need be unduly depressed by the occurrence of
such instances of the sad depravity of the native character; for
whilst deploring the miserable condition of the deceivers themselves,
he will know that even they must have received more distinct ideas
of divine truth than they otherwise would have had. For himself, he
will learn how little confidence c n be placed in any profession of
Christianity, which does not originate in a change of heart, by the
power of the Holy Ghost. Still, the Archdeacon found some encouraging
circumstances connected with the mission at Burdwan. In the report of
his visit, he relates:--

     ‚ÄúI had some conversation with Manick, a Brahmin who was
     baptized on the 16th of December. He had been for some time
     employed by different missionaries. I asked him, ‚ÄòWhat he
     had seen in Christianity which led him to embrace it?‚Äô he
     replied, ‚ÄòIn the Hindoo _poorans_ and _shasters_ there is
     no certainty: one asserts one thing, another, another; but
     here is a clear way‚Äô--‚ÄòIn what way in particular?‚Äô--‚ÄòMore
     especially in the way of worshipping God: in other systems
     a variety of ceremonies and rites must be observed; in this
     it is required only to pray to God alone‚Äô--‚ÄòWhat have you
     learned to pray for?‚Äô--‚ÄòDaily I pray for pardon of sin;
     for this I daily require.‚Äô--‚ÄòWhat do you understand by
     sin?‚Äô--‚ÄòWhatever is not according to God‚Äôs commands.‚Äô He
     then, in answer, repeated briefly the substance of the Ten
     Commandments; and said that every one must labour to fulfil
     them to the utmost of his power, thoug  no one could do it
     perfectly. A good deal more conversation followed.‚Äù

The next communication from the Archdeacon shews him to have been
still anxious respecting who mig t be Bishop Heber‚Äôs successor. It is
addressed


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, April 7, 1827.

     ‚ÄúIt is now a year since Providence was pleased to withdraw
     our Bishop, and we have no tidings of a successor. We shall
     no doubt, hear in due time, but the delay of arrivals keeps
     us, also, in ignorance how matters stand with those who
     are dear to us in the bonds of nature. Since the beginning
     of January, we have continued to reside at Cossipore
     chiefly. The quiet, freedom and airiness of the situation
     is very agreeable to us; and when a Bishop arrives, I shall
     have less occasion to be so frequently in town. The ship
     that carries this, carries also Mr. Perowne and family.
     His removal just now is very painful, on account of the
     m      , as you can well judge. Deerr will reside there;
     but declines taking charge of the m      . Mr. Wilson
     will go up every month: he has been three times since you
     left us; and is very acceptable to the people; and we may
     hope the work will go on. Dear Abdool Messeeh is gone to
     his rest. A tumour somewhere in the back, of which he
     had nearly died two years ago, proved to be a carbuncle,
     broug t on mortification and death. He always spoke of it
     as a boil; and his little medical knowledge proved indeed a
     fatal thing to him. But his end was according to the tenor
     of his life,--peaceful, intelligent, resigned. His last
     sensible breath was expended in singing a hymn, of the kind
     and meaning of that in Simeon‚Äôs collection, ‚ÄúLord, remember
     me!‚Äù[131] An obituary is sent home, which you will no doubt
     see.[132] Mr. Reichardt will now have the principal charge
     at Mirzapore. His German order and system, is becoming
     very important to us. There are three catechists, who
     oug t to be lectured once a week at least: and an account
     kept of their labours for the information of the Society.
     Mr. W. seems as if he could not do this. He will talk
     and preach from morning to nig t; but this particularity
     seems to him, resting in the letter; but Reichardt thinks
     otherwise, and rightly; and will labour also to render
     the whole a spiritual service. My sphere, as far as it
     appears, is about Benares. There our friends require only
     to be led; and I feel I have no power to command. I am
     expecting 300 Rupees a month [from Government] for Mr.
     Morris, as minister of Chunar. Greenwood is coming down to
     the Calcutta Grammar school, perhaps has arrived there;
     and Morris can officiate also in Hindoostanee, leaving
     Bowley free to itinerate. The Society will be relieved, in
     part, by these means, besides in some degree accredited by
     Government. Indeed, since I have been in charge, Government
     has done every thing I asked. Both Mr. H. and B. and Lord
     Combermere, have, in official matters, shewn much kindness;
     and I ask nothing else.... The expences of the m      ,
     of necessity increase, as the work increases. Bowley now
     requires three bungalows in different villages, where
     influential people have embraced the gospel; and their
     neig bours desire, also, to hear more of ‚Äòthis way.‚Äô Mirza
     Bagir, son of the traveller, Abu Talib Khan, was baptized
     last month. Mr. W. Bird was the means of his becoming
     acquainted with the Scriptures, and sent him to Bowley for
     baptism.‚Äù

In a communication addressed, in May, to the Church M      ary
Society in England, the Archdeacon enters more fully into some of
the encouraging circumstances, and prospective difficulties, then
attending m      s, and which are touched upon in the letter given
above.

     ‚ÄúOpportunities open on every side for m      ary work: but
     we cannot meet them. I agree entirely, that the prospect
     of good, and not present local patr  age, should move us
     in attempting new plans; but everywhere the population
     is very large, and access to them comparatively easy.
     Government has granted to Mr. Morris at Chunar 300 rupees
     a month, in consideration of services rendered to the
     native congregation; but new openings round that station
     call for increased help. One convert baptized last year,
     has, from his fisher‚Äôs death, become heir of his property
     in land: a place of worship is required in his village;
     with a school, and a native catechist. A Zemindar, also
     lately baptized, possessing property in land in a village
     opposite to Chunar, has called for the same kind of aid: a
     bungalow is building, and a catechist will reside with him.
     Thus success in our labours entails increased expense. We
     may hope that Divine Providence will raise up aid; but at
     present, we see not how. We may indeed, hope that the days
     of indifference on the part of the British are gone by, and
     that our Bishops will continue, in succession, to uphold
     the work of evangelization; but it seems to me that the
     most trying period for all our plans may yet be to come.
     Till help be raised up among the natives, or the Government
     take up the subject, the work will be up hill: we cannot
     expect the natives to join heartily till they taste the
     good of what is broug t before them; and that will not
     be, humanly speaking, till the young now educating, grow
     into active life. The Government has given a precedent
     at Chunar, of helping to afford instruction to converte        natives; but till congregations are collected, Government,
     on the present system, cannot help directly. Fifteen or
     twenty years then must pass on this ‚ÄúSystem of Mendicancy,‚Äù
     as Bishop Heber well termed it; and as we feel it to be,
     in a way which you at home cannot well understand: _you_
     address congregations where all acknowledge the duty, and
     profess faith in God for its success--_we_ mix with those
     who scarcely acknowledge the duty or utility of attempting
     the conversion of the heathen, and have no hope of success.
     We are encouraged however, to persevere; and I trust that
     our faith will be found of a kind more precious than gold
     that perisheth, though it be tried, and sometimes as by
     fire; and that, after all, chiefly from within.‚Äù

During the summer of 1827, the Archdeacon had his equanimity somewhat
disturbed by the intelligence that the sermon which he had printed
on the death of Bishop Heber, only for circulation among his own
friends, and those of the deceased prelate, had been made public in
England. With reference to that circumstance, he writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúI am filled with concern to hear that my sermon has been
     reprinted in England. It was intended to be purely private,
     and I sent some copies to be distributed privately. It will
     be fine game for the reviewers: well, I must be content.
     No man ever less soug t publicity, or was less fitted for
     the trials connected with it. I have been led from one step
     to another, and it is singular that those with whom I have
     felt most closely united, have seemed least to rejoice in
     my advancement from time to time. I have acquainted you
     with some of my experience in the school of authority; and
     it has made me desire retirement more than ever; yet how I
     shall leave this country, except ill-health compel me, I
     know not.‚Äù

It must not be omitted to mention, that with the administration
of the diocese of Calcutta, during this vacancy of the see, was
connected a more active attention to the operations of the Society
for Propagating the Gospel, and of the Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge, than the Archdeacon had before felt called
upon to give. To this was added an occasional correspondence
with the English functionaries of those Societies. The following
communication addressed to the secretary of the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge, will not be read without interest:--

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, Sep. 15, 1827.

     ‚ÄúI had yesterday the honour to receive your letter of March
     1st., and beg to offer my best thanks to the venerable
     Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, for its
     acceptance of my offers of service, and to yourself for the
     obliging manner in which your communication is conveyed.
     On the subject of the Native schools, I would respectfully
     call your attention to the condition on which I proposed to
     transfer the funds to the Society for Promoting Christian
     Knowledge; viz. ‚Äúif the Society for Promoting Christian
     Knowledge send out no more Missionaries.‚Äù It is with
     reference to the superintendence alone any difficulty can
     arise. My humble opinion is, that all the Societies in the
     Establishment should strive together in the good cause,
     and each support as many schools as it can, each at the
     same time supplying superintendence for its own schools.
     In this way all classes who support our Establishment
     will be induced to lend their aid; and it is agreeable to
     the constitution of human nature, and not contrary to the
     gospel, that each Society should labour to support its own
     schools whilst it rejoices in the prosperity of all. The
     superintendents being amenable to one Society, whilst the
     expenses of the schools are supplied by another, has led,
     I must say, to less exertion, and a less strict economy
     than would otherwise have been the case; and as in the case
     of the Rev. Mr. D‚ÄôMello at Howrah, some of his schools
     being supported by the Society for the Propagation of the
     Gospel, whilst others of them are supported by the Society
     for Promoting Christian Knowledge, causes a perplexity
     in our proceedings, which the public will not take the
     trouble to understand. My purpose, however, in writing now
     is not to oppose but merely to put you in possession of
     the true state of things here, and my earnest endeavours
     shall be directed in conjunction with the other friends
     of the Society here, to promote its interests and uphold
     the credit it has justly acquired by its long and most
     beneficial labours in the cause of pure and undefiled
     religion. In its English department it is unrivalled, and
     the edification afforded by its lending libraries in this
     country cannot be expressed in adequate language.

     ‚ÄúThere is a circumstance connected with the support of
     native schools which has not been prominently broug t
     forward; viz. the providing of school-books. This is a
     source of considerable expense, but without incurring it,
     schools are utterly inefficient. The school-book Society
     supplies its books to religious Societies at half-price;
     these are mostly of a mere elementary character, but
     necessary in their place. Besides these, our Diocesan
     Committee printed an edition of the discourses, miracles,
     and parables of our blessed Saviour, which has long been
     expended. The Diocesan Committee‚Äôs National schools
     have been supplied from time to time with copies both
     of the whole New Testament, and of the Gospels and Acts
     separately, by the Calcutta Auxiliary Bible Society, and
     with copies of a catechism on the evidences and leading
     doctrines of Christianity, and of Watts‚Äô catechism, and of
     dialogues on the events related in the book of Genesis, by
     a Mr. Ellerton, from the press of the Church Missionary
     Society (all gratis,) in Bengalee. Last week at a meeting
     of the Diocesan Committee‚Äôs Society for the Propagation
     of the Gospel, I submitted to the meeting the necessity
     of printing the books most sought after by the Natives,
     after the gospels, viz. Watts‚Äôs Catechism and Ellerton‚Äôs
     dialogues, at the press of Bishop‚Äôs College. A question
     then arose, at whose expense should they be printed, the
     Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, or the Society
     for the Propagation of the Gospel? and this question is
     to be discussed next quarterly meeting. In the meantime
     the schools will be supplied from the former sources. The
     Rev. Mr. Tweddle has been resident since June last in the
     Society‚Äôs house, connected with the Russypuglah circle
     of schools, and is greatly encouraged by the attention
     which many of the adult population pay to the subject of
     Christianity. Several have professed their desire to be
     baptized, but he delays a little to prove their sincerity
     and impart further instruction. In that neighbourhood the
     desire for schools is very urgent, and all, be it observed,
     are willing, I might say desirous, that the Christian
     Scriptures should be introduced. The objection to the
     Scriptures seems chiefly among the Brahmins and Pundits,
     and they counteract, without great care on the part of the
     Missionary, the willingness at least of the people to know
     something about the Gospel. The wise and the learned among
     the Hindoos, as formerly among the Greeks, are, generally
     speaking, least disposed to attend to the things which
     belong to their peace. To the poor the gospel is preached,
     and they will receive it; and as a wealthy native lately
     observed to me respecting native female education, ‚ÄòWe
     shall soon be obliged to teach our daug ters letters, for
     all the poor are becoming more knowing than the rich:‚Äô so
     the superiority of character which Christianity produces
     in the poor will force the rich to reflect on their ways.
     Till then, we shall have to struggle with scanty funds and
     poor converts; and how long that may be, God only knows,
     but in due time we ‚Äúshall reap if we faint not.‚Äù If you
     will have your schools prosper, and produce the fruits
     of righteousness, pray send Missionaries; but allow me
     to say, other kind of men are wanted here, than would
     suit well enoug  for North America. We want, besides
     good character, activity, aptness to learn languages,
     and to impart instruction. A Missionary who should come
     here merely to impart instruction in English would only
     waste his Society‚Äôs money, disappoint the expectations of
     those who sent him, and expose the ministerial character
     to contempt. The natives can perceive, and do admire the
     disinterestedness of a man, who can be content with
     little, whilst he spends his strength in native labours;
     but a clergyman living among a few Europeans at an
     out-station, without other employment, would be liable to
     be considered as on some account or other disgraced; like
     some who have been dismissed the service of government with
     a pittance to subsist on.

     ‚ÄúI might perhaps have omitted to write now, as we have
     heard of the appointment of a Bishop; but I am anxious to
     afford to those who, like yourself, take an interest in the
     Church in India, information respecting the true state of
     our affairs. The reviewer of the church in India notices
     the many applications to Bishop Heber for Missionaries; and
     a     indication of improved feeling among Europeans here,
     it is a most gratifying fact; but if it should lead any to
     offer himself as a Missionary under the idea that English
     services were the chief thing required, and this idea
     should not be corrected by those who send him forth, the
     effect would be to misapply missionary-funds, and to fill
     India with a poor clergy to the saving of a rich Government.

     ‚ÄúAccept, I pray, my unfeigned apology for any thing I have
     written which may appear irrelevant or uncalled for. As
     far as I know myself, my only desire is to promote the
     interests of the Established Church in these lands. I shall
     not again intrude myself on your attention; and at the age
     of fifty, in a climate like this, and after twenty-one
     years service, cannot expect to be of much use to a cause,
     the prosperity of which constitutes my chief joy.‚Äù

                            CHAPTER XVI.

     ARRIVAL OF BISHOP JAMES--CONSECRATION OF THE BISHOP‚ÄôS
       COLLEGE--DEATH OF BISHOP JAMES--VISIT TO THE UPPER PROVINCES.


Although Dr. James was consecrated Bishop of Calcutta on the 3rd
June, 1827, yet intelligence of his appointment to that See, did not
reach Calcutta till toward the close of the year. In the meanwhile
questions and difficulties had arisen, which the authority of a
Commissary was not sufficiently recognised to settle, and the letters
of the Archdeacon contain, in consequence, many expressions of
anxiety for the arrival of the Diocesan. To his brother he writes:--

     ‚ÄúI have sent home several folios of late about Missions
     and other matters: some private to Mr. Sherer, some to Mr.
     Bickersteth. If you have any curiosity about such matters,
     you may gratify    by referring to those sources; for I am
     weary of the subject, though it is getting every day more
     perplexing, and deserving of more attention.‚Äù

The domestic affairs of the Archdeacon were, also, a source of trial;
for the health of his children (especially that of the eldest,) had
of late been gradually suffering from the climate, until    became
necessary to arrange for sending them to England, accompanied by
their mother. In the prospect of this separation from his family, he
writes


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                  ‚ÄúNov. 12, 1827.

     ‚ÄúAltogether, we concluded that it was the will of God that
     they should proceed to England. Wherein we have decided
     amiss, the Lord pardon us; for I am painfully certain
     that not every movement that comes recommended by fair
     appearances, is from above, but often to prove whether we
     trust God or not.‚Äù

And after the day of actual separation had arrived the Archdeacon
writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, Dec. 14, 1827.

     ‚ÄúThe ship which carries this, sails at the same time
     with the ‚ÄòDuke of Lancaster,‚Äô which carries my earthly
     treasures. I try to think of my children as going to
     school, and their Mother going to take care of them. This,
     in our circumstances, is duty; but I have known no trial
     to be compared to it, except parting with Mary, when I
     went the first time to embark at Portsmouth. I cannot, in
     sober thought, bring myself to resolve on following them;
     but much may arise to render it proper, if not necessary:
     and as I made no positive resolve on leaving home about
     returning, I make none now about remaining here. When our
     infants were called away, their Mother and others in their
     stead were left. Now all are going; but there is hope, in
     every sense, of meeting again. I feel too proud, I fear, of
     my children, as most parents perhaps do. Their Mother and
     I have enjoyed as much of happiness, as earth affords; and
     remembrance of happiness only will follow her: whether ever
     to be renewed, He only knows certainly who is engaged to
     make all things work together for our good.‚Äù

The time was now approaching when the Archdeacon was to be relieved
from his duties as Commissary, for within a month of the date of the
preceding letter, he writes


                             TO HIS WIFE.

                                               ‚ÄúJanuary 21, 1828.

     ‚ÄúThe Bishop is at length arrived. He was installed
     yesterday. On Monday the report of the ‚ÄòMary Anne‚Äôs‚Äô
     arrival reached us; on Friday [Jan. 17,] we went down,
     Messrs. Eales, Abbott, Mill, Cracraft, Prinsep (the
     younger.) We found the ship at Culpee, near to where we met
     Bishop Heber. Bishop James resembles him much in appearance
     and manner. He is evidently of a kind disposition, and for
     my own part, I have much reason to be satisfied with my
     reception.

     ‚ÄúI have not ascertained any of the Bishop‚Äôs plans, nor
     perhaps has he yet settled any. I mentioned the residence
     in the Upper Provinces, but he did not think the Archdeacon
     could be spared from Calcutta, on account of the frequent
     absence of the Bishop.‚Äù

The bishop, however, expressed a wish that, subject to his own
instructions, his correspondence with the Chaplains and the
Government, should be carried on by the Archdeacon, but it does not
appear that any plan to that effect was settled. As regarded himself,
the Archdeacon occupied his comparative freedom from public business,
in assisting the chaplains in their clerical duties, in finishing the
translation of the Prayer-book and the Homilies into Hindoostanee,
and in superintending a translation of the Prayer-book into Persian
by Mr. da Costa. These were all afterwards printed, either by, or by
the aid of, the Prayer-book and Homily Society. With reference to
these occupations, the Archdeacon writes


                             TO HIS WIFE.

                                                  ‚ÄúFeb. 12, 1828.

     ‚ÄúI have been officiating at Howrah, and the same sermon
     enabled me to assist Goode; so that I have not been idle,
     and am much the better for it.‚Äù

And again:--

     ‚ÄúI know not what C. has taken [to England] for you: I
     told him to take you a copy of the translations of the
     Common Prayer. I send three copies, by this ship, to the
     Prayer Book and Homily Society. It is found fault with, as
     Martyn‚Äôs Testament was; but I care little, as time will
     bring to light the labours I have gone through; and those
     who can improve it may.‚Äù

He adds--

     ‚ÄúI have been much moved by the affection of the
     Hindoostanee congregation for John Adlington. He has always
     been more disposed to suffer in silence, than to complain;
     yet after some time the Native Christians became so
     attached to him on account of his ministrations, that one
     day, on going to Church, he found a _punkah_[133] hung up
     for him. The place for the Communion table being bare, one
     begged to be allowed to place a mat on it. Another placed
     a carpet, where John stood to minister; and lately one
     came and said, he had been so comforted at the Communion,
     that he begged to be allowed to present a silver cup, and
     wished to know what shape John would have it made in.
     These are genuine expressions of Christian Native feeling,
     beyond what has appeared here; for Bowley is a great
     disciplinarian, and his people are more under awe than
     John‚Äôs flock. These facts the Hindoostanee Homilies brought
     to my mind; for the translation is now read to the people.‚Äù

It has now to be observed, that as the frequent correspondence which
the Archdeacon maintained with his wife, during the time that she
was absent from India, affords a kind of Journal of the writer‚Äôs own
feelings, and of such occurrences as passed under his notice, little
more for the present is necessary than to subjoin extracts from his
letters to her. Thus, under date of April 7th, he writes:--

     ‚ÄúI should tell you that Mr. Deerr had a most interesting
     occasion last week, at Culna; he has baptized five persons
     there, and another offered himself. The new Christians
     begged the baptism might take place in their quarter of
     the large spreading town. No appropriate building being
     available, Mr. Deerr had a table set under a tree, in a
     large Mango grove; the table covered with ‚Äòa fair linen
     cloth,‚Äô and on it a marble basin full of pure water.
     The Christians sung a hymn. About one hundred and fifty
     assembled. Mr. Deerr preached from ‚ÄúHallowed be thy name.‚Äù
     All were hushed in silent attention; not a sound besides
     Mr. Deerr‚Äôs voice, except the gentle sighing of the breeze
     among the branches. Mr. Deerr hopes a good impression was
     made. A little circumstance characteristic of the people
     must be added: after the service, an old woman came up to
     Mr. Deerr full of bustle, ‚ÄòSir,‚Äô said she ‚Äòone of your
     Christians owes me money, command him to pay me.‚Äô Mr. Deerr
     said this was not a suitable time for such business. ‚ÄòSir,‚Äô
     replied she, ‚Äòif I am not heard in so holy an assembly,
     where shall I get justice?‚Äô‚Äù

It might seem an unkindness to his memory to keep back another
portion of the same letter, illustrative as it is (with many other
extracts that might be given) of that enduring strength of natural
affection, with which the subject of these Memoirs was so peculiarly
imbued.

     ‚ÄúThis is a day, on several accounts, to be remembered by
     us. It is your birth-day; it is also close on my own. It is
     a day long to be remembered, too, for the sorrow we were
     visited with ten years ago; when our John was removed from
     this scene of trial, to behold his Father‚Äôs face in heaven.
     It is fit that we should call these things to remembrance;
     whilst deep humiliation becomes us, before Him who has been
     about our path all our days. We have much, also, to praise
     him for, both as it respects the past, and the present. I
     think of you now as about the Channel, approaching your
     desired haven. How the weather may have proved, and what
     the society on board ship, and whether my children have
     escaped all accidents, and how your health has been? These
     are anxious questions [to which] I must wait some months
     for an answer. To what, also, may await you in England. ‚ÄòIs
     my father yet alive,‚Äô the ‚Äòold man‚Äô to whom we all owe so
     much? But why perplex myself on these accounts? I could not
     but observe yesterday, how blessed is the appointment, that
     time alleviates the feeling of loss. What agonies did we
     endure, when our John was taken away? Of Emily, I confess,
     I think less, because I knew her not as you did; but now
     it seems well, that they are safely lodged in the Lamb‚Äôs
     bosom, and it would be unkind to wish them back. O may our
     two remaining loves hear the Saviour‚Äôs voice, and in their
     early youth, know the love and kindness of His heart!‚Äù

The Archdeacon afterwards forwarded to his wife, the following
memorandum:--

                             ‚ÄúCalcutta, Thursday, April 10, 1828.

     ‚ÄúThis day completes my fifty-first year. The last year
     has proved very eventful in several respects. The change
     in my circumstances by the departure to England of
     my wife and children, is great and painful beyond my
     expectation, though I anticipated painful things. The
     change in the circumstances of the Church Mission, by
     the sickness of several, and the defection of others, is
     painful to a degree. A blight seems to have come over
     my temporal prospects; and much reason is there for
     self-examination, as to why I am thus: but I need not go
     far, nor search long. To my own soul, at least, the cause
     is so obvious as to silence all complaints. If these be
     not for my individual sin, yet my sins deserve much more
     of mortification and shame. In company, vain words and
     compliances leave a sense of sin that would drive me
     to solitude: solitude cannot be improved without the
     grace of solitude. Indolence, preference of amusement to
     profit, want of delight in the Scriptures; in public and
     in private, in the pulpit and in the closet, in capacity
     to benefit myself or others, is brought more power fully
     home to me, as I advance in life. And will it ever be
     otherwise? And how can I meet death in this state? I know
     theoretically the fulness, freeness and sufficiency of the
     Saviour‚Äôs grace, but am I a partaker therein? I can think
     of my beloved family without exertion, and follow the
     intimations of my wife‚Äôs will, though she be far removed
     from the knowledge of what I do, or power of contradicting
     me; were the love of the Saviour as really in me, would it
     not operate in the same way with reference to His will? I
     know it would; and pray to be kept from self-deceiving. O,
     may I take no rest until I have the evidence of that faith
     in me which worketh by love, and overcomes the world, the
     flesh and the Devil! I resolve that thus it shall be, the
     Lord being my helper.‚Äô Amen.‚Äù

In a subsequent letter the Archdeacon writes to his wife:--

     ‚ÄúI have been very busy since I last wrote. A poor creature
     who killed his wife in a fit of jealousy, sent for me last
     week; and I visited him several times before the day, and
     on the morning of his execution. My dreams for several
     nights were of prisoners and fettered captives, imploring
     help. The man was a native of Dacca, a Native christian,
     spoke English with considerable fluency, and had acquired,
     from attending on Michael Rosario, a considerable knowledge
     of Scripture: and had not his awful crime called for more
     pungent sorrow than he exhibited, he might have passed out
     of life with a good name for christian knowledge. To his
     own master he hath given an account. The day after this
     poor creature left the world, I was startled by a note from
     G. saying, ‚Äò_his brother was indeed gone_!‚Äô We had heard,
     of his (the aid-de-camp) illness, but had no idea he was
     in danger: but so it has come to pass. That finely-formed
     youth, who was, perhaps, too proud of the personal
     advantages God had given him, was seized with fever,
     and sunk under the effects, [of it] in a few days, aged
     twenty-one! Poor R. G. when he found his brother was in
     danger, spoke to him of the Saviour: and the dying youth,
     it seems, poured out a prayer, t   , for Christ‚Äôs merits,
     he might find a place in His kingdom. ‚ÄòAnd this,‚Äô says R.
     G. ‚Äòis the only ray of light that this dark dispensation
     affords.‚Äô‚Äù

The following letter records an interesting passage in the history of
Bishop‚Äôs College, Calcutta.

                                                   ‚ÄúMay 16, 1828.

     ‚ÄúYesterday was Ascension day, and it was a ‚Äòhigh day‚Äô
     at Bishop‚Äôs College. The consecration of the chapel and
     burial-ground took place. All the clergy were invited
     by advertisement. The Bishop said that he should be at
     the Ghaut,[134] opposite the College, at five o‚Äôclock in
     the morning. I left home, therefore, at four: Latham and
     Adlington went with me. We arrived first; and as the Bishop
     had said that his coach would be full, we took advantage of
     a dingy,[135] and passed over before him,--but there was
     no meeting, or any reception at the Ghaut. We mustered at
     Mill‚Äôs; and from thence proceeded to the place appointed
     for a burying-ground. M. had prepared a shepherd‚Äôs crook,
     gilt, with an ornamented staff; and this was carried before
     us, by a Native christian from Madras, with a coat of
     crimson colour, such as you know they wear on the coast.
     We then assembled in the anti-chapel of the chapel, and
     the Consecration service began; the gilded crook being
     carried before us, up to the Communion-table. The ceremony
     was then gone through, and M. preached the Sermon from
     Malachi i. 2. ‚ÄòFrom the rising of the sun even until the
     going down of the same, my name shall be great among the
     Gentiles, &c.‚Äô In the conclusion, he quoted part of the
     prayer used by Bishop Middleton, on laying the first stone;
     and pointed to his monument on the wall. I was, perhaps,
     the only person present besides himself, who had taken part
     in that ceremony. Mr. Schmid , the Old Church organist,
     had been engaged, with his three school-singing boys, and
     also a finger organ for the occasion. They chaunted ‚ÄòThe
     _Venite_,‚Äô ‚Äò_Te Deum_,‚Äô ‚Äò_Jubilate_,‚Äô and sang an Ascension
     hymn before Communion, and after Communion, an anthem from
     the eighth Psalm. The Armenian deacon was present in his
     festival robes, which were of yellow stuff, with a collar
     worn as our scarf, figured with large crosses embossed. The
     Bishop provided a breakfast in the hall, to which forty
     persons sat down.

     ‚ÄúMay 18th. We are just returned from the Cathedral, W. and
     J. Adlington were ordained priests. Henderson preached the
     sermon. Dear John, as pale as death; but he got through
     without distress. When we commenced the Communion Service,
     and I was reading the prayers for the Church militant, the
     remembrance of the last ordinations, and of the beloved
     Bishop Heber, came so strongly upon me, t    I could
     scarcely give utterance to the expression of thanks for
     those departed in the faith and fear of God our Saviour: I,
     however, got through. The whole congregation were kept the
     whole time, but only Mrs. James, and Miss O. communicated,
     besides the clergy.‚Äù

In the letters which Archdeacon Corrie wrote about this time, he
frequently mentions the failing health of Bishop James. Thus he
writes in a communication, dated

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, June 30, 1828.

     ‚ÄúThe Bishop left this place last week, [for the Upper
     Provinces.] He continued very ill past Chinsurah. He has
     constituted me his commissary for this Archdeaconry, and
     the other Archdeacons for their‚Äôs respectively; and so
     devolved everything upon us, reserving only the power of
     interfering when he pleases; and that before any definitive
     sentence shall be passed, reference shall be made to him.
     Had the former Bishops done this, they might both, perhaps,
     have been alive still; and had not the present Bishop
     their fate before him, he might not have thought of such a
     measure; and if there be a real necessity for it, as to a
     considerable extent there is, there should be more Indian
     Bishops.‚Äù

This deputing of the administration of a portion of the diocese
to the Archdeacon, necessarily increased his occupations; yet his
correspondence intimates that he neither declined to perform ordinary
clerical duty as occasion served, nor to attend to affairs of
missions. Scarcely a month however had elapsed, ere increased illness
obliged the Bishop to return to Calcutta; and so seriously unwell
was he on reaching that place, that it was not considered advisable
for him to land. Respecting the Bishop‚Äôs state of health, Archdeacon
Corrie writes,


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                       ‚ÄúCalcutta, August 8, 1828.

     ‚ÄúBishop James has been, and now is, at death‚Äôs door, from
     liver complaint. He was affected with it in England, and
     this climate has excited the disease, almost to death, if
     indeed he survive. He has sent in his resignation of the
     bishoprick, and is gone to New Anchorage to embark on board
     the Huntley, for Penang. He told me that his plan is, to
     stay awhile at Penang, and go from thence to Bombay, and,
     if possible, to New South Wales, and so to England. Thus we
     are again without a Bishop, although he will be nominally
     so, whilst he remains within the Company‚Äôs territories.‚Äù

With reference to missions, the Archdeacon adds:--

     ‚ÄúA blessing is vouchsafed to Deerr‚Äôs labours, beyond
     most. He has lately baptized eleven persons, viz. five at
     Burdwan, and six at Culna. Our Report exhibits sixty added
     to the Church; and since May 1s , fifteen more. Simon, one
     of my school-boys, has resigned a salary of eighty rupees
     a month, to engage (unsolicited) in Missionary work. Thus,
     among many discouragements the gospel grows among us.‚Äù

During the ensuing month the Archdeacon had occasion to visit some of
the stations on the river; and observes in a memorandum: dated

                                          ‚ÄúFultah, Sep. 18, 1828.

     ‚ÄúBy unexpected circumstances I find myself here, just
     twenty-two years since passing a day here on my [first]
     arrival in India. How altered for the worse is this place!
     How many changes have I seen since then! How altered in
     contrast, are my circumstances! A stranger then, wandering,
     friendless, and in my own apprehension, poor; for I
     understood in England, my salary would be three hundred
     pounds a year, and was warned that it would supply no
     superfluities. Though this was a mistake as to sterling
     amount, and there was something, I apprehend, of a pious
     fraud used, to prevent my taking the appointment from
     temporal motives;--though I have enjoyed much beyond what
     was then contemplated by friends or myself, yet I am still
     poor; though, blessed be God, neither friendless, nor
     without a certain object in life. When I say poor, I mean
     in worldly reckoning, for I am rich, in not caring for
     riches. I have long seen that they add neither to personal
     worth, nor public usefulness; except as used with a single
     eye, to the grace and goodness of God in granting them. As
     to objects, I now see what is practicable, in reference to
     the spread of the gospel in the land, which I was utterly
     ignorant of when I came here in 1806; and what reason for
     thanksgiving to God is there, that times and circumstances
     are so much more favourable now! Then all was untried and
     uncertain to a great degree; now the work of Missions is
     better understood; success has been in many instances
     granted to it, and the duty and probability of success of
     the work made, in a considerable degree, manifest.‚Äù

At the time the foregoing remarks were penned, the Church in India
had been again deprived of her chief pastor, by death; although the
intelligence of Bishop James‚Äô decease did not reach Calcutta until
the 17th of Oct. In apprising Mrs. Corrie of that mournful event, and
of his preaching the Bishop‚Äôs funeral sermon, in the cathedral on
Sunday morning, Oct. 19, the Archdeacon writes:--

     ‚ÄúI took for a text Job xxx. 23, [‚ÄúI know that thou wilt
     bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all
     living.‚Äù] I offered--

     ‚ÄúI. Some reflections on our situation in the world. As
     rational creatures, we are subject to a law which we
     have broken, in consequence of which death reigns. But a
     reprieve is proclaimed, and an offer of escape from the
     second death made by Jesus Christ.

     ‚ÄúII. Christianity can render the prospect of death and the
     grave, comfortable--‚Äòa house,‚Äô ‚Äòa home.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúIII. But it is by self-application that it does so; ‚Äú_I
     know_ that thou wilt bring me to death.‚Äù

     ‚ÄúIV. And by a determination to live under the influence of
     the self-application. ‚Äú_I know_,‚Äù is experimental, not mere
     theory.

     ‚ÄúApplication, 1s . Let every instance of mortality around
     us, lead us to set our house in order; thus we shall be
     growing in capacity for the enjoyments and employments of
     heaven. Nor can our conduc , in this respect, fail to have
     a powerful influence on our general character, as members
     of society. He who thinks not of death, and of preparation
     for it, cannot set an example of religious living to
     others. He who wilfully postpones the subject, will shun
     solitude; the concerns of a future state will be, as much
     as possible, kept out of sight, and temporal considerations
     will be all in all.

     ‚ÄúFinally, with reference to the occasion of my appearing
     in this place to-day, to men who live not under the
     impression of death and the grave, the removal of one after
     another, of the chief pastors of the Church, will appear
     in no other light, than the removal of secular persons.
     The improvement in the religious condition of our own
     community being suspended, and the consequent influence
     such improvements might have had on the immortal interests
     of the natives, among whom we dwell, being interrupted, and
     to a considerable extent postponed,--these will not enter
     into the consideration of those, who value not Christianity
     as the only ground of a sinner‚Äôs hope; the only guide of
     his judgment and practice. How many of our countrymen
     now proceeding in an irreligious course, might, by the
     example, and the exertion of great attainments put forth
     in the service of religion, aided by the influence of high
     station, have been turned to a life of righteousness! How
     many of the youth, among our countrymen at our stations,
     exposed to every wind of temptation, with scarcely any
     controlling influence, might by such exertions, and such
     influence, have been saved from premature death, and
     rendered heirs of everlasting life! These and similar
     considerations, will not enter into the calculations of
     men who live only for the present world. True Christians,
     however, whilst they sympathise with bereaved relations and
     friends, mourn chiefly the loss of the immortal interest
     of mankind, involved in these, seemingly premature,
     bereavements. They will pray that surviving ministers may
     be enabled to redouble their diligence and zeal; as their
     work is no less, and their disadvantages greater. They
     will pray that the Lord of the harvest may send suitable
     labourers into the great and important field of labour;
     and then, whatever may be the result as to others, our
     own enjoyments will be heightened, by conscious attention
     to the duties which present circumstances call us to; and
     we shall be kept in patient continuance in well doing;
     waiting for that glory, honour, and immortality, which the
     Lord, the righteous judge, will give to all who love his
     appearing.‚Äù

By the premature death of Bishop James, the administration of the
diocese of Calcutta devolved for the second time on Archdeacon
Corrie; and it could scarcely be supposed, but that the increased
demands on his time which these changes brought with them, would
to some extent debar him from corresponding so frequently with his
friends, as he might formerly have been able to do. We find him,
therefore, now observing to his valued friend, the


                          REV. J. BUCKWORTH.

     ‚ÄúAmong the causes of my not writing to you, one is,
     that much of what I write home is published, so that
     you know generally what I am abou . This circumstance,
     also, has contributed to the difficulty I often find in
     writing to friends. The publication of my letters has
     at times occasioned me great uneasiness, chiefly on my
     own account. You cannot but know how little qualified I
     am for the public sphere unto which I have been called.
     You know, also, how little in early life I intended it;
     and, I can truly say, I have never desired it, and now
     greatly wish for the shade, my proper place. Another
     cause of my unfrequent correspondence is, the wearisome,
     inward conflict I endure, with little or no intermission.
     I travel, indeed, heavily on the heavenly way. Few, I
     think, can be burdened as I am with the body of sin and
     death. My views of the plan of salvation have been clear,
     I apprehend, from the early part of my course; and I may
     thank you, in no small degree for this; but every now and
     then, the evil of my heart breaks out, as it were, more
     inveterately than ever, and I seem ready to perish. The
     text of the first sermon you preached at Stoke, is my
     stronghold at this time, Psalm xxv. 11, ‚ÄúFor thy name‚Äôs
     sake, O Lord, pardon my iniquity; for it is great.‚Äù It
     needs infinite mercy, and infinite merit; and _both_ are
     manifested in Christ Jesus.... These interruptions, and the
     differences which have arisen amongst the religious public
     with you, make me fear the latter day glory is not to be
     revealed so soon as once was generally apprehended. I see
     no reason to differ from Scott‚Äôs general view of Scripture
     truth; but I observe most of those at home, who contend so
     strenuously for the personal reign [of Christ,] and those
     here, who have been most dissatisfied with Missionary
     matters, are high doctrinal men. Well, the counsel of
     the Lord shall stand. His hand goes not forth even now
     in vain: where humble men persevere in setting forth the
     Saviour, as the sinner‚Äôs only hope, some are drawn to Him.
     Souls are added to the Church frequently, at almost every
     Missionary station; and the Word of God is taking root, up
     and down this part of India. Three remarkable instances
     have lately come to light, of individuals far removed
     from each other, in the upper parts of the Presidency,
     receiving incidentally the New Testament [translated,]
     taking it home, and, after understanding the blessed
     contents, calling their friends and neighbours, to hear the
     Scriptures read. In one case, the man was murdered; though
     it is thought for his wealth, rather than in a way of
     persecution. In another case, the man was obliged through
     persecution to flee from his native place, and in the
     third case, as a brother of some influence in the place,
     has taken a decided part in favour of the gospel, it is
     hoped more good will result to the neighbourhood. But the
     labourers are very, very few; and if larger salaries are
     [not] to be given to Missionaries, the number must diminish
     rather than increase. It seems as if we must labour more,
     to raise up labourers on the spo . This has always been an
     object with me; but I have had but little success. Now,
     indeed, some young men, born in this country, are coming
     forward to offer themselves for Missionary work. The
     characters of such, in a natural point of view, are almost
     always less robust than that of Englishmen. Their bodies
     are generally feebler, and the mind seems to partake of the
     same. They, however, assimilate more to the natives; seem
     to bear with their feebleness of character, and meet the
     case of the unconverted with more readiness than Englishmen
     can do, from the entirely different channel in which
     their ideas flow. It is, perhaps, never intended that the
     Indian should equal the European in energy; and we must be
     content with things as the God of nature intended them. My
     attachment to the country increases, as my acquaintance
     with the people, and, also, the language, becomes more
     familiar. I must mention, that during the last year, and
     with the help of competent assistants, I have translated
     and have printed a complete copy of the Book of Common
     Prayer. Every letter and tittle of the Prayer-Book is now
     clothed in the Hindoostanee language, and will become
     increasingly useful, as the borders of our Zion become
     enlarged.‚Äù[136]

At the beginning of November 1828, Archdeacon Corrie set out to
visit the Upper Provinces of Bengal. A Journal of his proceedings is
contained in his correspondence with his wife.[137] Thus he writes
from

                                          ‚ÄúBurdwan, Nov. 8, 1828.

     ‚ÄúI yesterday, at half past ten o‚Äôclock, went to Bogbonar:
     Candy and Hammond went with me. I felt relieved on getting
     away from Calcutta. At twelve the tide turned. I had a long
     look at our sweet Cossipore abode. The Ganges is unusually
     full this season, so that by the time I reached Serampore,
     the tide turned again. I stopped therefore at Marshman‚Äôs,
     where Mrs. J. Marshman gave me a kind welcome.

     ‚ÄúBearers being procured, I set off soon after four o‚Äôclock,
     for Chinsurah; but it being Kalee-poojah, they were tipsy.
     At first, they shouted and joked; afterwards, getting
     tired, they quarrelled, and scolded, and, amidst deafening
     noise, I did not get to Herklot‚Äôs till 8 o‚Äôclock.... I
     set off for Burdwan, where I arrived before ten this
     morning. Deerr and his family are well. They have two fine
     children, a boy, and a girl, very like each other, and the
     picture of health. My mind is kept in a measure of peace.
     I have begun the book of Joshua, for travelling reading.
     I trust Joshua‚Äôs God is with me; and that I go on my way
     according to His will.

     ‚ÄúSunday, 9th. This has been a day of mixed feeling. In the
     morning, I met the native Christians at family worship.
     There were twenty-two presen . There are two sick, and
     three absen , making twenty-seven adults, besides children.
     A converted Brahmin read 1 Cor. xi.; and Deerr interpreted
     what observations I wished to make to them, on the Lord‚Äôs
     Supper. They seemed to understand. Something also was
     said to the women, on the honour conferred on them by the
     gospel, in restoring them to their original state, as the
     helpmeet of man, and fellow-servants of the Lord. They
     seemed to understand, and were very attentive. At ten
     o‚Äôclock, Divine service in English; about fifteen presen .
     Knowing that the Bengalee worship was waiting, I did not
     prolong the English service beyond half-past eleven--got
     back to the Mission-house quarter before twelve o‚Äôclock;
     but the [Bengalee] worship did not commence till half-past.
     After a selection from the morning prayer, and a hymn,
     Deerr preached on the institution of the Lord‚Äôs Supper. I
     found that three men and two women had not been instructed
     with reference to the Sacramen , and at my desire they
     withdrew. The Lord‚Äôs Supper was then administered to ten
     men and six women; I read the prayer of consecration in
     English. I then pronounced the words in Bengalee, which
     I had written down in Roman characters; and gave the
     bread, and Deerr the wine. The whole went off, I trust,
     in an edifying manner; and, on the whole, thankfulness
     prevailed.... One end of my coming was, by this means
     to try some, and promote the edification of others. It
     is found that being baptized merely, does not prevent
     return to caste: partaking of the Lord‚Äôs Supper does. In
     consequence, one tried to evade putting the bread into
     his mouth; and another, on drinking of the cup, nodded
     slily to another, as much as to say (in my interpretation
     of his look and manner) ‚ÄòWe are caught.‚Äô This is sad: but
     some are sincere beyond all doubt; and, I may be mistaken
     in my judgment of others. Mrs. Deerr and her sister say
     of the women, that their carelessness (as it appears
     to me) is merely their shyness at the appearance of a
     stranger. One thing was very pleasing, they were almost all
     well-looking people; clean, and nicely dressed--and gave
     me the impression of being the better sor . The two I have
     mentioned as sick, are a young Brahmin and his wife. He is
     upwards of six feet high, with quite the erect, independent
     look and manner of the Brahmin--He is of the highest caste.
     One uncle is Treasurer to the Commercial Bank; and a cousin
     is the Dewan[138] of the Burdwan Rajah, at one of his
     Purgunahs.[139] Notwithstanding the favourable appearances
     here, it would be easy for an unfeeling man to break up the
     work; and render what is doing, matter of worldly scorn.
     The English around are too careless to take notice of what
     is doing; and too ignorant of the ways of the people among
     whom they dwell, to judge rightly. I have always been
     averse to exciting too much attention in them to missionary
     work, knowing how easily an ungodly man might turn it all
     into ridicule. But from my inmost soul, I rejoice even in
     these very imperfect beginnings--I am sure they are the
     beginning of better days.

     ‚ÄúNov. 20th. I am now within four coss [eight miles] of
     Benares, on the Calcutta side of the Ganges, waiting for
     bearers, who ought to have been waiting for me. You are
     made acquainted with my intention of visiting the missions
     here. I wrote to you from Burdwan on the twelfth. On that
     day I went to Bancorah, and had a rainy and very tiresome
     journey on account of the broken road. I received great
     kindness from Dr. and Mrs. Clarke--Dr. C. laid my _dawk_,
     so as to admit of my resting every night at one of the
     stageing bungalows, and I am,   us far, rather refreshed
     than otherwise by the journey. I am glad to have travelled
     this road; for after having traversed in all directions
     the valley of the Ganges, I had no idea of the varied
     scenery which borders on it; on the west side, as well
     as the east. About one hundred miles from Calcutta, at
     Bancorah, the ground begins    rise: the range of hills
     we saw at Cuttack, runs on the left hand (going upwards);
     and you proceed through an uneven surface of country,
     (the scenery a good deal like the Dhoon,) ascending for a
     hundred miles more. Then a table-land commences, of nearly
     another hundred miles, but abounding in ups and downs;
     and presenting, at different points, views such as we saw
     in the Himalahs; only by no means on so grand a scale....
     At about three hundred miles from Calcutta, steep ghauts
     occur; and by degrees, the traveller gets to the plains you
     know so well.

     ‚ÄúNov. 22, 1828. I arrived about twelve o‚Äôclock on the 20th
     at Secrole. On the way from a large ghaut, where I crossed
     the river, a new, tall steeple, pointing to the skies,
     attracted my eager eyes, as I approached Secrole. You
     cannot conceive what a picture the Church is now become.
     The inside enlarged by the removal of the internal wall, to
     the nor h, and the south; and the verandah inclosed. A new
     pulpit and reading-desk of really exquisite workmanship;
     and the front of the organ-gallery of the same; executed,
     as the whole has been, under Mr. J. P. Prinsep‚Äôs immediate
     eye. A well-propor ioned stone font, placed near the west
     entrance; and the whole arranged with real taste and
     propriety. I could fill sheets with all I see and hear. I
     will only now add, that the state of this station affords a
     striking comment on the sin of despising the day of small
     things. I used to come, first to Wheatley‚Äôs back parlour,
     and meet a few writers and artillery men. We then got an
     unoccupied house, and all the station assembled; but next
     week, an alarm was taken: ‚ÄòThe discontented would take
     advantage of our assembling, and fall upon us, and cut off
     all the English together.‚Äô General M. would no more allow
     the artillery-men to attend. Thomas B. declared he would
     not again venture into such a ruinous dwelling; but strange
     to say the house is yet standing. We then assembled in
     S‚Äôs. house, every third Sunday: and after two more years,
     I ventured to circulate a proposal for building a place
     of worship, out of which, by remarkable progress as you
     know, has sprung the present commodious and really elegant
     structure. The new Missionaries are not arrived here yet;
     nor likely to be here for ten days to come.

     ‚ÄúChunar, Nov. 29. To my great joy, the church is
     substantially repaired, looks better than ever, and is
     likely to stand a century. I yesterday had evening service:
     the Church was full; not less than two hundred and fifty
     people, including three officers and their families, of the
     Regulars. Last Sunday I had service twice at Secrole. P.
     was here. To-morrow I purpose having service twice here.
     This will testify of my strength; for indeed, not being, by
     my situation, called to it, I would not attempt so much, if
     I suffered from it.

     ‚ÄúBenares, Dec. 6th. 1828. Crauford, Wilkinson, Bowley,
     Eteson, and Frend have arrived; who, together with Proby,
     make seven Padres: and to-day Mr. Adams, of the London
     Society, and Mr. Robertson, of the same, came in. We
     commenced soon after ten o‚Äôclock, and continued till after
     two. We. discussed the signs of the times, with reference
     to the spread of the gospel among Europeans and Natives
     in India. The utility of schools where boys leave early,
     and the evidences required in adults, in order to baptism.
     Each spoke in turn, and, on the whole, order was kept; and
     all seemed gratified. It was admitted, that the progress
     of the gospel advances. Many instances were adduced of its
     gaining a hold on the native public. One man, eighteen
     coss from Allahabad, heard the gospel from a Missionary;
     and received a copy of the New Testament. He read it at
     home to his family; his neighbours also came to hear,
     till the usual effects began to appear; some siding with
     him, others opposing. Lately he came to Mr. Crauford,
     to know what he must do. A Fakeer received a gospel,
     and sent it to his village in Goruckpore district. His
     brother, a Thannadar,[140] had, also, received a gospel
     from Mr. Wilkinson. The two brothers now unite in reading
     the Gospel, and collect their neighbours to hear. The
     raising up of native teachers was also adduced: and the
     power of Divine tru h, in rendering aged Hindoos active
     and industrious in spreading the knowledge of the gospel,
     instanced in several cases. Schools were admitted to be of
     incalculable value; especially as rendering the visits of
     the Missionary welcome to the adults of a village; and, it
     may be hoped, in preoccupying the mind with some degree
     of useful knowledge; though, as yet, no direct instances
     of conversion have come to light in the schools. It was
     agreed, that repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord
     Jesus Christ, should be required in candidates for baptism:
     but it was also agreed, that the fruits of these would
     appear in vast variety, and be differently judged of by
     Missionaries; so that no one should judge another in the
     admission of converts. In the evening, I preached in the
     Church from John xvii. 20, 21. ‚ÄúNeither pray I for these
     alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through
     their word; that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art
     in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that
     the world may believe that thou hast sent me.‚Äù

     ‚ÄúDecember 12th. Yesterday we passed at the mission
     bungalow. Mr. E. from Ghazeepoor also joined us. So that
     there were eight padres. The forenoon was passed as the day
     before. We discussed the influence the personal character
     of a Minister is likely to have on his office; and agreed
     to some resolutions on a prayer-union, as formerly set
     on foot by Mr. Brown. This may prove a blessing to others
     also. At dinner, much discussion arose about recording
     conversations with natives on religious points; and the
     general opinion was favourable to its utility. I was asked
     to print my sermon, preached on Wednesday evening. If I see
     any prospect of usefulness, I may do so.[141]

     ‚ÄúDec. 13 h, 1828. This evening, I have experienced
     the greatest pleasure in Hindoostanee worship, I can
     remember ever to have done. About sun-set, I rode into
     the Bazaar, and saw a crowd; and on approaching, I found
     the missionaries with Tryloke, raised on the steps of
     a door; T. arguing with great seriousness, and perfect
     calmness of manner, and the people listening attentively.
     There had been levity, it seems, displayed by some of
     the crowd before I came; but they were then all serious;
     and T‚Äôs manner and appearance were very patriarchal. I
     was much solemnized by the scene: we then adjourned to
     the preaching-house. Charles prayed and read our Lord‚Äôs
     discourse with the woman of Samaria, with a comment,
     adding also some appropriate remarks of his own, and
     ended with prayer. Kewal Messeeh, then, commenced a hymn,
     in Hindoostanee; and a few joined him. The measure also
     was Hindoostanee. The words, and his correct manner,
     affected me much; and arrested the attention of many of
     the hearers. It was to the effect of ‚ÄúO Jesu, Saviour,
     God, shew mercy;‚Äù and then instanced several proofs of
     his power; and the last verse was an exhortation to trust
     in that mercy, as the only safe way of salvation. Tryloke
     then read a sermon on, ‚ÄúThere is joy in heaven over one
     sinner that repenteth.‚Äù He read with animation, but towards
     the conclusion of his prayer, his earnestness for his
     neighbours, and especially for his own family, was very
     affecting. He seemed to wrestle for a blessing upon them.
     Doubtless these are the fruits of the Spirit; and God‚Äôs
     presence is evidently with them.

     ‚ÄúSunday evening, 14th. This forenoon, a full church at
     English service. At three o‚Äôclock, p. m., Mr. Frend
     read prayers in Hindoostanee, with wonderful propriety,
     considering the short time he has been in the country.
     His pronunciation is distinct, and he would be perfectly
     understood, though some words were imperfectly expressed.
     After prayers, three adult converts from Hindooism were
     baptized by Mr. Bowley. The mother of one of them came in
     an agony to church, and also his brother; but he refused
     to forego his purpose. After church, the poor woman seemed
     more resigned, saying, ‚Äòher son was old enough to judge for
     himself; and she did not know what might have moved him to
     the step.‚Äô The family live near the church. Another was a
     teacher of a school; the third was brought to the faith of
     Christ by means of an Indigo planter, and sent hither for
     baptism. He gave his mala[142] to Mr. Eteson, saying, it
     was once his treasure, ‚Äòbut now,‚Äô said he, ‚Äòthese are my
     treasures;‚Äô referring to a Hindoostanee Prayer-book and
     New Testament he had under his arm. After the baptisms,
     Mr. Wilkinson             Hindoostanee, on the baptism
     of the Eunuch. I could not but be very thankful for the
     means of instruction thus supplied. I felt how much better
     the people of this place were off, in respect of means of
     grace, than when I resided here; and, I think, I was, from
     my heart, content to sink in the scale; and that these
     devoted servants of Christ should become in every way more
     useful, and as ministers, more honourable; and may an
     abundant blessing follow the instructions afforded here
     this day!‚Äù

     ‚ÄúDec. 25 h, 1828. This day has been a day of thanksgiving.
     At church, I preached, and administered the Sacrament of
     the Supper, with Proby. Thirty-eight attended the Lord‚Äôs
     Supper, of the English congregation; and I found Mr.
     Eteson had above twenty communicants, at the Hindoostanee
     Chapel. P. is, at times, all gloom, as if this were a day
     of vengeance for Benares; and the people were filling up
     their measure of wrath. I maintain, that he would be of an
     opposite opinion, could he have seen the place twenty-three      years ago. I am much importuned to go to Goruckpore; and
     propose leaving this to-morrow night, by _dawk_, for
     that quarter. I go only five stages by bearers; and then
     expect to find a buggy the rest of the way. You will
     conclude, that at times, I feel anxious about who may be
     the next Bishop; and you will, I know, give me the earliest
     intelligence you can. The two young men last arrived
     promise well; and at times, I am ready to think that means
     for forwarding the kingdom of Christ are rising up around,
     which may render my services of little consequence, and
     then, I should think, I had better withdraw. But who shall
     reckon on to-morrow? May we labour for the things which are
     eternal; and whether in India or England, we shall have the
     presence of the Saviour to support and comfort us!

     ‚ÄúGoruckpore, Dec. 29, 1828. On Sunday I          twice for
     Mr. E. In the morning, the singers sang a psalm-tune I do
     not recollect to have heard since I left Colsterworth. It
     reminded me strongly of early days.... The band-master was
     clerk: and is a man of real piety, and more than common
     propriety of manners. The singing is well conducted there.
     A new church is building, on a plan supplied by Bishop
     Heber; but the drain of money, caused by the Burmese war,
     has caused all matters which require money, to go on very
     slowly, ever since. At nine o‚Äôclock in the evening, I left
     Mr. E. and came on in a palanquin towards this place.
     Through the kindness of Mr. Bird and Mr. Wilkinson, I had
     five relays of horses, and a buggy waiting on the road: so
     by seven in the morning I mounted the gig. On the bank of
     the Ganges, I found Mr. Bird in a tent, waiting for me,
     with b   kfast ready. We made a comfortable meal, and he
     afterwards drove me through a country, finely cultivated,
     to Goruckpore; where we arrived just after sun-set.
     This district has been reclaimed from the forest nearly,
     since the English gained possession; and a quantity of
     the forest-trees remain, in scattered clumps, which give
     a rich appearance to the country. It is in sight, too, of
     the perpetual snows; and is seldom scorched as the plain of
     the Ganges is. R. B. has a house of the best style of the
     Moffusil,[143] surrounded with quite a park.

     ‚ÄúTuesday, 30th. After b   kfast, I set out to explore the
     mission-   mises here; and was much gratified indeed with
     the general appearance. First, came the Christian houses,
     situated close to the town; with a field of about three      acres    cultivation before them, towards the high road.
     On the north side of this field stands the seminary, as
     it is called. A pucka[144] building, with two lower rooms
     at the north end; and over them one sleeping room. The
     whole verandahed all round, with tasty pillars, in front
     of the dwelling part. This forms a most comfortable abode
     for a single man. In this will dwell a country lad, named
     Raphael, whom I b ought up from Calcutta. He seems to have
     received religious benefit from Crauford‚Äôs Friday evening
     catechizing, at the old Church room; and is mentioned in
     the last Report of the Church Missionary Committee, as a
     missionary student. He came over here with Wilkinson, from
     Benares; and you will be glad to hear that both W. and R.
     B. are favourably impressed with what they have as yet seen
     of him. Next to the seminary, eastward, across the road,
     is the Church, at present levelled with the ground. The
     last year here was unusually rainy. The earth became so
     saturated with rain, that all the wells were running over;
     and the sandy soil becoming thus impregnated with moisture,
     the foundations of the Church gave way. R. B. with his
     usual decisio   pulled it all down; and is now employed
     in rebuilding it on piles, and on a broader foundation;
     intending, also, a less ponderous roof. Behind the Church,
     eastward, is the parsonage; a very pretty and commodious
     building. It consists of a lower room to the west, and one
     of similar dimensions to the east; with two rooms on e   
     side; a verandah all round, and corner rooms to each side:
     a complete Indian dwelling, outhouses in abundance; and a
     fine garden, kept up by the prisoners sentenced to hard
     labour. The whole extent of ground is about twelve acres;
     which is made over to the Mission, including the site of
     the Church. I must not forget to mention a nice building,
     nearly finished, intended for christian girls: and called,
     in joke, ‚Äòthe nursery.‚Äô Sarah Bowley was to have come here,
     to take charge of it, but this plan is suspended, owing to
     the departure of Dr. and Mrs. Clarke. Perhaps Bowley and
     his daughter will come here, for the hot season; and then
     the plan will proceed. All these temporal advantages, the
     Mission owes to Mr. B; and it is a matter of thankfulness
     that he has notice of being appointed Commissioner here,
     on the new system; and will now, (if spared) in all
     probability, continue here several years.

     ‚ÄúYou will now have some idea of the external state of
     this place; but cannot adequately conceive of the beauty
     of the situation of this part of India. But now for the
     better part. On my going into the Mission-house, all the
     Christians collected, old and young; and the room was
     filled. I could not speak to them all at once, and so
     proposed a hymn. We sang the thirty-fourth of Bowley‚Äôs
     Hindoostanee translation, and then some from Betteah were
     introduced, the children of persons who had received copies
     of the Gospels from me at Chunar, and which are kept now as
     relics. Raphael, one of my school-boys, is major-domo of
     the christian settlement; and shewed it to me with g   t
     glee. The aged Zemindar, and several converts from Islam,
     conversed for some time; and two or three Hindoo devotees
     sat ‚Äòclothed‚Äô beside us, ‚Äòand in their right mind.‚Äô On
     coming away, I saw one of these talking with g   t
     earnestness to a fat Fakeer, covered with ashes; he seemed
     to be repeating Scripture to him, but I did not stay to
     hear, lest I should put an end to the discourse.

     ‚ÄúWednesday, 31st. This morning at eight o‚Äôclock, I      assembled with the Christians at morning prayer in the
     school-room. Forty-three were present; of whom about ten or
     twelve were boys, of ten or twelve years of age or under;
     the remainder adults, male and female. The morning Psalms
     were read, in alternate verses, in Hindoostanee. The third
     of St. Matthew was then read, and the latter part commented
     on by Mr. W.; a hymn was first sung, I should have said,
     and all concluded with prayer, by Mr. W. Thus the word of
     God grows and inc   ses. About two  p. m. I went again to
     the Mission-house, and read the second Homily, and part
     of the third, with the Zemindar, and an intelligent young
     convert from Islam and a few others. They entered into
     the subject earnestly, and much conversation arose out of
     different parts of the reading.

     ‚ÄúJanuary 1st. 1829. I, this morning, went on the top of the
     house before sun-rise, and had a sight of a peak of the
     snowy mountains. It brought strongly to my mind Masoree
     Tabea, and the happy days we passed there in 1825: my heart
     yearned after our sweet children, and I tried to pray for
     them, that this may prove a happy year to them, and that
     through all eternity we may rejoice together. We had a
     New-year‚Äôs day service, with the native Christians; it was
     to me, and I believe to several of them, an interesting
     service; I spoke to them on life as a journey. I am almost
     constantly with you in spirit; and associate you in all my
     poor prayers, for mercy, and blessing. To-day news have
     arrived here of various movements, seemingly propitious.
     May divine grace accompany them to those concerned; and
     they cannot fail to prove so!

     ‚Äú17th. I have told you of all the people I met with, up to
     Monghyr. On the 14th, I got to Boglipore, and walked to the
     cantonments of His Majesty‚Äôs 3rd Regiment, now stationed
     there. They are on the Calcutta side of the old station,
     and the distance is considerable. I was rather heated,
     and could only leave word with a serjeant, that I would
     come up next morning to the school-house. After a while,
     the school-master came to my boat, a pious young man who
     received the knowledge of the truth under a Chaplain in New
     South Wales. He has been the means of drawing eight others
     to join in a religious society, and seems an estimable
     character. Next morning, at nine o‚Äôclock, I went up and
     found the commanding officer, Colonel C., at the mess-room;
     and five children with parents and sponsors assembled. The
     Colonel went with me to the school, where I catechised
     the Protestant children, and gave each a little book. He
     then went with me to the hospital, where I read prayers;
     and exhorted the convalescent, about twenty or thirty
     in number. The Colonel then took me, in his gig, to his
     bungalow, and introduced me to his wife, and a grown-up
     daughter. There was a little son also  who seemed g   tly
     pl  sed with a book I gave him. I was much pressed to stay
     and dine with the mess, but I had accomplished what seemed
     in my power, and declined the civility. I gave a good many
     of the tracts and religious books I mentioned, as having
     been brought out for me by Mr. Eteson, to the schoolmaster
     for distribution.

     ‚ÄúJan. 22nd. I am near Cutwa. It had been my intention to go
     over to Maldah, from below Chandree; but unexpectedly this
     river is still open; and the Manjee[145] said, it would
     make five days difference, as to the length of the journey;
     beside the delay of going over to Maldah: and I have been
     long enough absent from Calcutta, at this time. I hear,      also  that the Governor General is about Maldah, shooting;
     so that I should have had little comfort in the visit. At
     Berhampore, I called on the D‚Äôs, Mr. Hill, and the new
     Chaplain, Mr. Wintle; but remained only about three hours:
     there seemed nothing to detain me. I am expecting to see
     the V‚Äôs., this evening, or early to-morrow, at Krishnagur,      to call at Culna, and perhaps meet Mr. Deerr, and inspect
     the schools.... My rec   tion is drawing to a close, for
     the present, for Calcutta has never been a residence of
     my choice. On the whole, my journey has yielded all the
     pl  sure I expected. I have kept free from colds, and
     have reaped all the benefit of the change and variety....
     I have met with kindness everywhere; and seen much of a
     religious nature, to encourage. From long acquaintance
     with the natives, I have also derived amusement, beyond
     any other time, from observing their innocent sports. But
     alas! their language, even when in sport, is sadly corrupt.
     However, I see more and more, how little those who do
     not mix familiarly with them can know them. Their whole
     conduct may be construed either seriously, or as in joke,
     if necessity oblige them to conceal their real meaning.
     Christian knowledge is doubtless gaining ground, wherever
     Missionaries dwell. At Monghyr, Mr. M. told me that many
     natives now come to hear the word regularly. Mr. Hill, at
     Berhampore, told me the same. The interruption they used
     to meet with seldom occurs; and many listen attentively
     to the end of a discourse, instead of going out and in,
     as formerly. Still, it is but ‚Äòthe day of small things;‚Äô
     and, respecting the general population, but a very few
     come under the ‚Äòjoyful sound.‚Äô--I heard, at Monghyr,
     of a wealthy farmer, as you would s   in England, near
     Sheergotty, who received a Hindoostanee New Testament, from
     Mr. Bowley, in one of his journies back from Calcutta. The
     man read it to his neighbours also; and other Missionaries,
     who have since met with him, were delighted with the love
     he shewed for the truth. This man has lately been murdered;
     it is thought, on account of valuable ornaments he wore;
     but the particulars are not known. These incidental
     occurrences shew the value of itinerant labourers.‚Äù

      [136] It may here be mentioned that the Creed of St.

            attracted the attention of the learned Mahomedans,
            and the demand to possess it became consequently so
            g   t, that Archdeacon Corrie was induced to have
            several hundred copies of it struck off for separate
            circulation. One of those persons, on applying for a
            copy of the Creed, observed, ‚ÄúNow we know what you
            Christians believe.‚Äù The Archdeacon on rel ting this
            circumstance stated, also  that nothing could exceed
            the bitter enmity against the doctrine of Christ,
            which the exposition of divine truth contained in
            that Creed, seemed to stir up in the Mahomedan heart.

     GOVERNMENT RETRENCHMENTS--PLAN FOR A COLLEGE--DEATH OF MR.
       THOMASON--ABOLITION OF SUTTEE--ARRIVAL OF BISHOP TURNER.


It was on the 30th of January, 1829, that the Archdeacon arrived at
Calcutta from his visit tion of the Upper Provinces. He found some of
his friends preparing to leave India; and others suffering from the
effects of climate. Among the latter was Mr. Thomason, who had been
returned to India only a few months, but whose health had altogether
given way. With reference to such changes as were thus going on
around him, the Archdeacon writes


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                 ‚ÄúMarch 10, 1829.

     ‚ÄúI cannot at present see it my duty to prepare for leaving
     India. It is not, as you justly say, a country to grow old
     in, but my health is wonderfully renewed, and the work of
     missions, instead of becoming plainer, is daily becoming
     more difficult. It would appear that ease makes men more
     fastidious, yet the work does prosper. Piety does, however,
     appear now to be more requisite here than in New Zealand,
     as you well kn     at men of mere worldly principles can
     scarcely bring themselves to believe, that the natives of
     this country need conversion. A person of these principles
     going forth as a Missionary, therefore sits quietly down
     among the people, and if he superintend a school or two,
     thinks he does all that is practicable.

     ‚ÄúConjecture tires as to who may be our next Bishop, but I
     think we might have learned from the past, to ‚Äòcease from
     man.‚Äô‚Äù

Then with reference to the measures which had, about that time,
been adopted, for the purpose of revising and curtailing the whole
expenditure of the three Presidencies of India, the Archdeacon adds:--

     ‚ÄúAll here are in amazement at the turning of all things
     upside down, in the service; and know not what to expect.
     It is concluded that something is in view with reference
     to the renewal of the charter,--but what, no one can
     conjecture.

     ‚ÄúAs yet, we see not in ‚Äòthe powers that be‚Äô anything more
     favourable to true religion, than formerly. Education is
     encouraged, as it has been for some years past; but, as
     formerly, entirely from private funds. No hope of aid from
     government is held out. The only favourable symptom that I
     am aware of, is, that Mr. W. B. is to become a member of
     the Committee of Public Education. He has had experience of
     the ease with which Christian instruction can be imparted;
     and will do all he can to improve the present system.‚Äù

Soon after the date of this letter, the Archdeacon again alludes to
the state of public affairs in a letter


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúAt present there is gr  t uneasiness throughout every part
     of the community. The whole system of civil administration
     in the upper branches, is changed, and the most lucrative
     appointments cut off. The same duties are performed by the
     same men in another manner, and on reduced emoluments. The
     army has been reduced two companies in each Regiment, by
     which a crowd of young men are made supernumeraries; and
     the pay at some places is reduced, which it is thought
     is only a prelude to its being reduced generally. Among
     the natives gr  t alarm has been occasioned by an enquiry
     set on foot respecting all _lakhrage_ lands, not hitherto
     rated in the Government books. These consist of religious
     endowments and lands granted by former Governments for
     services done to the state. These, in some cases, have
     been resumed, and no holder of such estate is certain of
     retaining it. In the public offices many clerks have been
     dismissed, and by the civil arrangements above alluded
     to, very many are thrown out of employment. So that no
     one of any class or condition is s tisfied; and some
     parts of the army are all but in a state of mutiny. The
     most sober-minded I kn   of, think the making all these
     changes together, injudicious. The necessity of economy is
     the reason assigned for all this, but surely the splendid
     entertainments given by the Court of Directors in London,
     look not much like a necessity for taking from the mere
     subsistence of subaltern officers. I try to be silent and
     to wait the end. Certainly the personal character of our
     rulers seemed to [promise] us brighter prospects as to
     the encouragement to be afforded to Christian plans and
     improvement. But no--they give liberally of their own
     substance to Societies, but not a rupee, or a smile of
     approbation must come from Government; so that the ‚Äúsystem
     of Mendicancy‚Äù must continue some time longer.‚Äù

With reference to the same subject, the Archdeacon writes:--


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                  ‚ÄúAug. 16, 1829.

     ‚ÄúA thirst for learning English has discovered itself all
     over the country; which no doubt, looks hopefully, as to
     improvement. It is dispiriting, however, that we have so
     few Missionaries, and next, that the Government shut their
     eyes more obstinately than ever against every thing in the
     shape of Christian knowledge. In answer to an application
     for aid to a school at Meerut, in which Mahomedans, Hindoos
     and Christians are taught together, it was said, that
     it would not be right to appropriate funds intended for
     native education to instruct children of Europeans, i. e.
     Indo-Britons. And I have been applied to for an opinion
     about the removal of the Chaplain from Howrah, it not being
     right, Government thinks, to supply from funds raised from
     natives, a religious establishment for Europeans, except
     for the Company‚Äôs servants. I am endeavouring, with no
     little anxiety, you will suppose, to combat this view of
     things, and have been much assisted in the matter by W. B.
     who is a near neighbour. I wish you were nearer London,
     to speak a word to some of your old friends, now in the
     Direction, to get a distinct recognition of the right of
     native Christians, including country-born, to a share in
     the public measures for the improvement of the country.
     I have written to P. and shall write to Mr. A. to ask
     it, as he may, of Lord E. and the Board of Control. I am
     hopeless, yet the abstract right of the claim might gain
     a hearing where personal interest is out of the way; and
     the Government has always acted on the principle that the
     country-born should share.‚Äù

Yet this settled determination on the part of the Indian Government,
to leave Christianity and Christian education to shift for
themselves, had not the effect of slackening Archdeacon Corrie‚Äôs
exertions to secure by private aid, some of those advantages for the
Christian population, which he had solicited in vain from public
resources. Two months anterior to the date of the foregoing letter,
he had put into circulation in Calcutta, the outline of a plan
for establishing in that city an Institution, which should aim at
promoting the interests of true religion in connection with large and
liberal education.

In forwarding a copy of this outline, he writes:--


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

                                      ‚ÄúCalcutta, August 19, 1829.

     ‚ÄúBy the enclosed, you will see what has been occupying
     me, in part, for some time. The class of Indo-Britons,
     or East-Indians, as they begin to call themselves, is
     increasing very fast. Besides the number in charity
     schools, there are not less than five hundred in boarding
     schools, in this place. Not above one hundred perhaps can
     pay, so as to remunerate the masters; yet they are all
     descendants of gentlemen. Hitherto they have generally
     been idle, and dissipated; possessing all the vices of
     both father and mother, without any of the redeeming
     points in either. You will conclude there have always been
     exceptions. But, within these fifteen years, a change
     has been going on; and a great improvement is becoming
     visible among that class. Yet they have hitherto had no
     bond of union, and stand separate from all established
     order. The Dissenters, being more on a level with them
     in most respects, and really exerting themselves for the
     improvement of this class, would gain the majority of
     them ere long. I hope, if we can bring the plan of the
     Prospectus to bear, we may succeed in establishing a
     connecting link between the Church of England, and these
     really Colonists. The lower branch, or a Grammar-school,
     is first to be attempted; about twenty thousand rupees are
     set down, in shares and donations; and with a like sum in
     addition, we shall be able to make a beginning. A master
     will be wanted from England. We could, I think give him
     ¬£500 a year, and a house, worth here on the lowest scale
     ¬£250 more; with a per-centage on any profits that might
     arise.... We have a good deal to contend with: first, our
     Governor-general, to my great dismay, has all but avowed
     that the improvement of the Christian part of the Indian
     community is no part of his duty. Next, a most extensive
     forgery of Government-bonds has been discovered. Three
     hundred thousand pounds, it is said, is not the whole
     extent of it. Many who deal in the funds, find they have
     bought forged bonds; consequently it is not a good time for
     subscriptions. And last, not least, Liberalism prevails
     here too, as in England; and will neither do good itself,
     nor agree to any scheme proposed by others, if religion be
     included. But we must do what we can. O! my heart sickens
     at the proceedings of Parliament; and I feel resigned, at
     times, to give my bones to India, England being no longer
     the land of attraction it was. Another discouragement
     to the scheme inclosed is, that it has been declared to
     be opposed to Bishop‚Äôs College; whereas it will prove a
     powerful auxiliary, by supplying youths whose abilities and
     dispositions have been tried as students, and candidates
     for Missionary work. I am just now, also, much occupied
     with a correspondence with Government, on the subject of
     supplying religious instruction to Christians not in the
     immediate service of Government. I hold that they ought to
     be supplied. The correspondence, I expect, will be referred
     home. But who cares for religion in high places at home?
     and what can the Archbishop do, his office being so little
     set by?‚Äù

It remains now to subjoin an outline of the Archdeacon‚Äôs views,
respecting such a liberal education on Christian principles as, in
his judgment, was calculated to meet the anomalies and exigencies of
the several classes of British subjects in our vast Eastern empire.
He proposed, then,

     ‚ÄúThat a College should be founded in Calcutta, in which,
     whilst the various branches of Literature and Science
     should be made the subjects of instruction, an essential
     part of the system should be, to imbue the minds of the
     youths with a knowledge of the Doctrines and Duties of
     Christianity.

     ‚ÄúThat this College should be, in every way, conformable to
     the United Church of England and Ireland. But as there are
     also many in this land who are not members of that Church,
     and who are at present completely excluded from the means
     of bestowing upon their children a liberal education, it
     was further proposed that persons of all persuasions should
     be permitted to attend the various classes in the projected
     seminary, under certain restrictions, but without such
     restraints as should go to interfere with their religious
     opinions.

     ‚ÄúThat in conducting the Institution, a liberal and enlarged
     course of education should be pursued, adapted to the
     respective attainments of the Students; the College to be
     divided into two departments,--a higher department for the
     elder, and a lower department for the younger students.

     ‚ÄúThe system to comprise Religious and Moral instruction,
     Classical learning, History, Modern Languages,
     Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Medicine and Surgery,
     Chemistry, Jurisprudence, and other branches, as time and
     circumstances might admit of and require.

     ‚ÄúThe College to be open to the sons of native Gentlemen,
     as well as to all denominations of Christians; and to be
     divided into two sections, viz., one consisting of those
     who should conform in all respects with the regulations
     of the Institution, to be designated ‚ÄòMembers;‚Äô the other
     section to consist of those only, who might attend the
     classes for the purpose of receiving instruction.

     ‚ÄúThe advantages of the Institution to be available for
     all Students, with the exception of some theological
     privileges, which unavoidably would have to be restricted
     to the ‚ÄòMembers‚Äô of the College: no student, not being a
     Member of the College, to be required to comply with any
     religious form [of worship], provided he submitted to the
     general system of education, pursued within its walls.

     ‚ÄúThe benefit of attending any course of Lectures in the
     higher branches to be afforded to all who might be disposed
     to avail themselves of it, under the preceding and such
     other regulations as might be specified.

     ‚ÄúAll students entering as ‚ÄòMembers,‚Äô of the College, to be
     required to conform in every respect, to the Doctrines,
     Usages and Forms of the United Church of England and
     Ireland; and Members of the College only to be received as
     resident students within its walls, and these to be subject
     to such rules of discipline, and to such an extent, as may
     thereafter be agreed and determined upon.‚Äù

The great principle however, which it was purposed to embody in
the projected College was, that whilst in a Christian community
every system of general education ought to comprise instruction in
the doctrines and duties of Christianity; and whilst, in the then
existing state of society in India, to compel all students to comply
with the forms of Christian worship, would be to defeat the object
which it was conceived the Institution would effect, yet that in all
education the WORD OF GOD ought to form an indispensable element. It
was maintained by the Archdeacon that without this, the acquisition
of other branches of knowledge could neither be conducive to the
happiness of the individual, nor to the welfare of the state. It was,
intended, also, that the College should expressly have in view the
upholding of the ancient Institutions of England, and the inculcation
of those doctrines and that discipline which were professedly held
and taught by the Established Church. It was proposed, therefore,
that none should be ‚Äúmembers‚Äù of the College, who were not also
members of the Church of England; and that these should, as a
matter of course, be required to be present at Divine Service to be
performed within the walls of the College, and to be instructed as
Church-of-England-men.    It was whilst matters of such public importance engaged the attention
of Archdeacon Corrie, that intelligence of the death of Mr. Thomason
reached Calcutta. In noting that event the Archdeacon writes to Mr.
Sherer:--

     ‚ÄúYou will have heard of the Church‚Äôs loss in the death
     of Mr. Thomason. A blank is made not likely to be soon
     filled up. I preached a funeral Sermon last Sunday morning,
     (August 9), in his old pulpit, and did him what honour I
     could, but far beneath his worth.‚Äù

The Archdeacon had, also, now to encounter a bereavement which more
nearly touched his natural affections. His father had died during the
spring of 1829; and therefore, he writes


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                ‚ÄúAugust 27, 1829.

     ‚ÄúYours of the 6th of May, with Henry‚Äôs note enclosed,
     came to hand yesterday afternoon. The black seal led me
     to forebode the event which the contents of the letter
     confirmed. His great age made such an event probable, and
     to be looked for; and with the hope that we have that death
     to him was gain, we cannot complain, much less ‚Äòsorrow as
     those who have no hope.‚Äô A great, great blank is, however,
     occasioned by my beloved Father‚Äôs removal; and soon the
     elder branches of his family would be strangers to those
     around them on earth, but for the dear charges given to
     themselves.‚Äù

From his Journal (now so rarely kept) some insight into the
Archdeacon‚Äôs private communings is obtained in the following
memoranda:--

                                                  ‚ÄúSep. 11, 1829.

     ‚ÄúIf spared to the 20th, I shall have been twenty-three
     years complete in India. Many things of late combine to
     weigh down my spirits. The defection of Missionaries,
     and now of L. who though unwell, would not wish to stay
     if well. The inclination of Government, to withhold all
     aid from christian ministrations, even among Christians:
     beginning, at once, by withdrawing the Chaplain from
     Howrah. The death of my father;--and anxiety for my family,
     constitute a load of care. I am not constitutionally prone
     to despond; but neither can I throw off impressions as
     some can. The care therefore, of answering government,
     and providing for Howrah ... whilst they have rendered me
     anxious, have, also, stirred me up to exertion. Yesterday
     in conversation with the Governor-general, I was enabled
     to speak freely, yet respectfully I hope, on the duties of
     Missionaries. I pointed out to him the different line of
     study, and reflection on Missionary callings, required from
     that of a Minister to instruct Christians; and the wrong
     done to the English societies and the English public, by
     employing Missionaries otherwise than as Missionaries: and
     appealed to him, that, notwithstanding the duty due to this
     Government, whether as an English gentleman he could wish
     the mother country to be burdened with the charge of the
     religious instruction of India? That, I was quite certain,
     that by providing for the support of Christian instruction,
     as occasions arose, (on a moderate scale) that this
     Government need not be burdened; and, at the same time,
     England would be relieved. He said with regard to Howrah,
     he would consider more of the matter.‚Äù


                                                  ‚ÄúSep. 19, 1829.

     ‚ÄúIn conversation with Sir Charles Grey,[146] on the
     subjects lately started by Government, respecting the
     duty, or otherwise, of applying revenues, derived from the
     natives of this country to the support of religious worship
     among Christian settlers, he said, the anomaly ought not to
     be applied to that one subject alone: it commenced in our
     taking upon us to govern the country at all. A people of
     strange tongue, and customs every way foreign to theirs,
     come, and sit down among the Hindoos, and make them pay
     for administering laws, to which they had been unused, and
     introduce usages abhorrent to their modes of thinking.
     Now, if we can do this in one respect, why not in another?
     And if in mere political and prudential matters, for their
     good, as we say, why not in respect to religion, which we
     hold to be the greatest of all good?‚Äù

It will be seen that the same important subject had been adverted to,
in a letter, which in the prospect of the renewal of the East India
Company‚Äôs charter, the Archdeacon had recently addressed


                   TO THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY.

     ‚ÄúThere are some circumstances in the state of
     ecclesiastical affairs here, which it seems desirable your
     Grace should be acquainted with before the renewal of the
     East India Company‚Äôs Charter, with a view to their being
     put into some way of order at least, and settled by an
     acknowledged rule.

     ‚Äú1. It is not distinctly understood how the law of marriage
     stands in this country. It is acknowledged that the
     marriage acts have not had, and have not now, any force
     in this country; but Bishop Middleton held that this See,
     being attached to the Province of Canterbury by Act of
     Parliament or the Letters Patent, has become subject to the
     ecclesiastical law of England, which requires marriages to
     be celebrated by a Clergyman, and within Canonical hours.
     And this rule was generally adhered to till the late Bishop
     consented to an order of Government sanctioning marriages
     by public Functionaries, both civil and military; and
     directing them to be registered by the Registrar of the
     Archdeaconry: and thus matters stand at present. Some
     of our first lawyers say, that marriage by a layman is
     to all purposes good; others say, only to some purposes;
     that it binds the parties, but confers no right of dower
     on the widow, or of inheritance on the offspring. It is of
     great importance that some declaration on the subject, by
     authority, should be set forth. I know that a good deal
     of anxiety is at times experienced by some who have been
     married by laymen; and several sons of men of rank and
     property are among the servants of this Government, who
     may eventually be deeply affected, should any irregularity
     be discovered in the present system. Up to March 1828, the
     Chaplains were on all occasions applied to, to celebrate
     marriages, and they had often long journeys to make for
     this purpose; but now, unless they be near at hand, many
     do not care to send for them, whilst the sanction of the
     Government makes no difference whatever in the law of the
     case. An easy remedy would be, the keeping the number of
     Chaplains always full, taking measures that Chaplains
     retiring should be obliged to an early determination on the
     point soon after their return to England, and not, as at
     present, be allowed to linger on for years, keeping their
     places unsupplied. An increase of Chaplains is, I fear,
     out of the question; yet would it not be, if but a common
     regard for the credit of our religion and the religious
     welfare of Christian subjects existed where it should.
     In many of the districts of this Presidency, especially
     in those most favourable to the growth of indigo and
     sugar, and in some degree in all of them, many Christian
     settlers have fixed themselves. A District, your Grace
     will know, is as large as an English county; and if a
     Chaplain were appointed at the chief station, where most
     of the servants of Government reside, and where there are
     generally from five to fifteen families, they would be at
     hand to celebrate Christian rites in the District; and on
     Festivals, part of the Christians resident in the District
     would resort for divine service to the head station. If
     want of funds prevented such appointments, the necessity
     must be patiently submitted to, but from the ground-rent of
     the whole country, surely the East India Company ought to
     make some reserve for religious purposes beyond the mere
     wants of the military. But this is connected with another
     point to which I would now entreat your Grace‚Äôs attention.

     ‚Äú2. Hitherto it was thought here, that only the fewness
     of the Christian portion of the inhabitants prevented
     appropriations being made from the resources of Government
     for their religious instruction: but it is now answered,
     that Christians have no claim on Government for religious
     instruction, and that in fact it would not be right to
     appropriate revenue derived from the natives of this
     country, to the supplying of Chaplains to Christian
     settlers. Now the settler, properly speaking, (i. e.
     persons whose birth-place is in Britain, and who are still
     looking to Britain as a home,) are few in number. There are
     not above 1000 of that description beyond the boundaries
     of Calcutta, and not half a dozen of them in any one
     place. They are scattered over the face of the country.
     But if by settlers your Grace understand descendants of
     Europeans born in this country, and of which class many of
     the Indigo-planters, scattered up and down the country,
     are, and include in them descendants of private soldiers
     by native mothers, and children of all descriptions of
     British, and who have been increasing for more than 100
     years, it will, I think, appear that the term is not
     applicable to them. They are, to all intents, native-born
     subjects of this Government, the offspring of the soil. Of
     this class there are in Calcutta not fewer than 4000; and
     at all the principal stations of the army, and in every
     place where Europeans have been stationed, they are to be
     found from 30 to 300 at each. I have placed the subject in
     this light that your Grace may be aware of the true state
     of the class I have in view.

     ‚ÄúIt is said that European settlers have no claim on this
     Government for a religious establishment. I will not stay
     to argue that point; but then, I maintain, that these
     Indo-Britons are native-born subjects of the British Indian
     Government, and, therefore, have a claim on a Government
     not only Christian, but proprietors of the land: in fact
     both king and landlord. It has been officially announced
     that schools in which the children of Europeans (i. e.
     perhaps removed six generations from the European stock,)
     are taught together with Hindoos and Mahomedans, have no
     claim on the funds appropriated to native education. Shall
     we then apply to the British Parliament for an annual
     grant, as for Canada? The main object then is to procure
     from the proper quarter an acknowledgment of the duty of
     applying some part of the revenue of this country to the
     education and religious instruction of native Christians,
     in their proportions, as to that of Hindoos and Mahomedans.

     ‚ÄúIt is only lately it has become known here that the East
     India Company‚Äôs Charter is to be renewed in the next
     session of Parliament, which must plead my excuse for this
     intrusion.‚Äù

It was about this time that Archdeacon Corrie supplied the place
of the Government chaplain at Barrackpore, in the absence of the
Rev. H. Fisher, who had proceeded up the country. Except in that
particular, there occurred but little variety in the occupations of
the Archdeacon. His letters, however, mention his desire for the
arrival of the Bishop. Thus in writing to his brother he observes:--

     ‚ÄúI am by no means at ease in my appointment, from the
     increasing ill-will of people who neither do any thing to
     purpose themselves, nor will let those alone who are doing
     what they can. And if I add, that we have at this time the
     hottest weather I have ever experienced in Bengal, having
     no cessation day or night, for nearly a week past, and no
     immediate prospect of change--the catalogue of ill may
     seem complete. But, O! no ill have I experienced, compared
     with the least I every day deserve; and much of mercy
     remains to mingle in the cup. The departure of my beloved
     father from Colsterworth, seemed much to weaken my tie to
     England, his death still more. This country may now become
     my home for the remainder of my pilgrimage. My strength
     is wonderfully renewed, yet I cannot conceive of any in
     England, not positively ill, experiencing the lassitude
     I am seldom free from. Yet the younger sons of the best
     English families, are coming out in this service in crowds,
     and even the heirs apparent to titles; such we are told is
     the difficulty of providing in any creditable way, for the
     sons of the gentry.‚Äù

The Archdeacon adds:--

     ‚ÄúI know not whether you have time to read Reviews. I think
     they are, as far as the facts detailed can be relied on,
     the history of Providence, and the last article[147] in
     the Quarterly for April, seems on true grounds to forebode
     much distress to Britain. This also falls in, I think, with
     the prophetic intimations respecting these times. I see no
     ground whatever, for the doctrines of a ‚ÄòPersonal Reign,‚Äô
     or a first literal resurrection, but I do think with Scott,
     that the witnesses are about to be slain. Mr. Faber‚Äôs idea
     of _trouble at hand_, seems just in agreement; though I
     have no idea of two Churches being represented by the
     ‚Äòwitnesses.‚Äô There can be but one true Church; but whether
     it be the witnesses _continuing_ to prophecy in sackcloth,
     still, the result is likely to be the same; and England now
     in league with the Apostacy,[148] must not expect to escape
     the plagues, under which it shall utterly perish. Babylon
     is already fallen in the purpose of God, and unless
     England purge away the leaven that has crept into her, with
     Babylon must be her end.‚Äù

About the middle of November 1829, the Archdeacon was released from
much anxiety, and depression of spirits, by the return to India of
Mrs. Corrie. In announcing her safe arrival, he writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

                                                  ‚ÄúNov. 30, 1829.

     ‚ÄúTo me the mercy is beyond expression. You can never know
     the depression of a separation such as I have experienced.
     Death alone could have rendered it more hopeless, but
     scarcely less painful: but thanks be to God it is over, and
     if it be His will, may no such trial befal me again! Our
     anxieties are now about our children. They seem placed in
     most desirable circumstances: may the blessing of God but
     attend the instructions they receive! Whilst we cannot but
     desire that they should acquire useful knowledge, and not
     be altogether without the knowledge of the usual manners
     of their class in life, our hearts‚Äô chief prayer and
     desire of God for them is, that they may become wise unto
     salvation.‚Äô ... How precious that promise, ‚ÄòI will be thy
     God, and the God of thy seed!‚Äô But for this what could we
     do for them at this distance? But our God heareth prayer;
     He remembereth his ‚Äòcovenant to a thousand generations.‚Äô
     In reading Deuteronomy, the expression, ‚Äòthat it may be
     well with thee and _thy seed after thee_,‚Äô supplies both a
     stimulus to duty and an encouragement. Whilst we are about
     our Lord‚Äôs work here, He will be merciful and gracious to
     our children.‚Äù

It was now that there occurred an event of great moral and
political importance to India. All the Missionaries in Calcutta and
neighbourhood, had some months ago presented a memorial to Lord
William Bentinck, respecting the cruel practice of widow-burning;
and Government had been in the habit of discouraging that revolting
superstition without venturing directly to prohibit it. But, after
satisfying themselves of the feelings of the Native army and Native
community, the Governor General in Council, took the decisive step
of adopting a Regulation on the 4th of December, to the effect of
declaring ‚Äúthe habit of Suttee, or burning or burying alive the
widows of Hindoos, illegal and punishable by the Criminal Courts.‚Äù

Soon after the date of this Regulation, Bishop Turner, (who had
been consecrated in the preceding May,) arrived in Calcutta. The
Archdeacon having mentioned in a letter to his brother, that the
Bishop preached in the Cathedral for the first time on Sunday, 13th
December, observes

     ‚ÄúBishop Turner seems to com     a spirit of Christian
     conciliation. I will not say much lest I should be
     disappointed. He is, however, liked, and will be popular in
     all probability.‚Äù

Then after having stated how much the account which Mrs. Corrie had
given of his relatives in England, had ‚Äúrekindled in him a desire to
be again among them,‚Äù the Archdeacon adds,

     ‚ÄúI am however thought, I find, a party man in Church
     politics, and it may be so in part, but how far it is right
     or not you cannot tell. I have said to H. that it is an
     easy matter for you at home to cast your guinea into the
     treasury of this or that Society, in the hope that good
     will arise from it; but the _application_ of your bounty,
     is a more difficult operation. Whether Jesus Christ shall
     be set forth in the glory of His grace before the Gentiles,
     or shall be made a mere ‚ÄòMaster of the ceremonies,‚Äô as
     Hervey[149] expresses it, to introduce to the Divine
     presence human merit, is no indifferent question. And here
     we have to decide upon that question, in the application
     of English liberality. But indeed, brother, I try to watch
     over myself in this respect also; and if I had opportunity,
     could cooperate with even a Papist, in the conversion of
     the heathen. I do think, however, that what I have done has
     effected good.‚Äù

Then with reference to the late Government Regulation he observes,

     ‚ÄúIf I should say nothing about the abolition of Suttee, you
     would think it strange. Great honour has the Government
     gained in this matter. Addresses of congratulation to Lord
     W. B., from the European Society, and from the Hindoo also,
     and Mahomedan classes, are getting signed by numbers.‚Äù

To his Sister, also, the Archdeacon writes

                                                  ‚ÄúDec. 17, 1829.

     ‚ÄúThe glorious abolition of Suttee, will distinguish the
     present Government, when the discontent arising from
     retrenchment will be forgotten.‚Äù

Then with regard to the expected renewal of the charter of the East
India Company, he adds

     ‚ÄúThe more general admission of Europeans into this
     country seems determined upon; which will help forward
     the progress of Christianity, in its remote consequences;
     but will probably ruin many in a temporal point of view.
     From all I can learn, commerce is a losing concern to the
     merchant generally. The mere agent, of course, deducts his
     commission from the scanty produce, and thrives. But what
     is all this to you, I begin to think, although, indeed,
     in its consequences, it may extend even to Morcott. A few
     years, I have heard some experienced men say, is likely
     to produce a general crash; and then our dividends and
     pensions may be put in jeopardy: so that mere selfishness
     might make one alive to national affairs; whilst to the
     Christian they supply matter for much prayer and solicitude
     before God. My favourite theme, inspiration and song,
     is much involved in all this progress of things. It may
     be that in time of adversity men may consider how much
     their all depends on God, and may becom  more careful of
     missionary work, which is so peculiarly His own. We have
     had days of ease and outward prosperity, and little heart
     has been found, and little of a right spirit, even in those
     who favour the righteous cause.‚Äù

Of the new Bishop of Calcutta, the Archdeacon observes--

     ‚ÄúHe promises to be everything desirable in his station, and
     you will be glad to hear that he approves of all my public
     acts. I have shewn him, also, a letter which I wrote to the
     Archbishop of Canterbury, all of which he approves and
     said, that he had nothing to do but to follow up the views
     there stated.‚Äù

Withi  a month of the date of this letter, one of those failures
in the mercantile world occurred, which som  ‚Äúexperienced men‚Äù had
anticipated. The Archdeacon, writing ‚Äúof general news,‚Äù observes


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                         ‚ÄúCalcutta, Jan. 8. 1829.

     ‚ÄúThe failure of Palmer‚Äôs house has created the most
     extensive ruin for a long time experienced. Three millions
     are said to be the extent of the debts: they promise to pay
     half, but it does not seem [to be] expected. This, with
     the forgeries you have heard of, amounting, I am told, to
     twenty-two Lacs, have given a lesson of the uncertainty
     of riches such as perhaps never occurred, at one time, in
     any single community before. It is impossible to enumerate
     the losses sustained by individuals. Some reduced from
     wealth to nothing; others from a pittance to beggary. Truly
     ‚Äòriches make to themselves wings and fly away,‚Äô but this
     will make no one, it is to be feared, less eager in the
     pursuit of them.‚Äù

After relating some private matters connected with the state of
society in Calcutta, the Archdeacon proceeds

     ‚ÄúThe Bishop held his first Visitation last Wednesday, the
     6th inst. He had appointed me to preach, and afterwards
     I was requested by the Bishop and Clergy to publish the
     Sermon. The Bishop told me privately that it was the
     thing of all others, he should wish to send to England at
     this time. I feel grateful for the acceptance, whilst I
     cannot but feel, that time and circumstances, and not the
     merits of the Sermon, call it forth.[150]... The Bishop
     seems bent on conciliation, with more decision than his
     predecessor.... He has becom  Patron of the Calcutta Bible
     Society, President of the Church Missionary Society, and
     is to preside this evening at a public meeting of the
     Bible Association in the Town Hall. He has attended the
     examination of schools, at Mirzapore, Mrs. Wilson‚Äôs school,
     the Female Orphan Asylum, and other Institutions.

     ‚ÄúJan. 16th. Among the sudden changes which occur here
     frequently, not the least unexpected, is the severe illness
     of the Bishop‚Äôs Chaplain, and the necessity, as the doctors
     affirm, of his return to Europe. In consequence, the Bishop
     requested as a personal kindness, that we would take up our
     abode with him. After two days deliberation, we have agreed
     to do so, not without much apprehension on my part. To keep
     a conscience void of offence, both towards God and man,
     will, I fear, not be easy; but many advantages may arise
     from the arrangement, if we can but keep the even path of
     duty. The Bishop may be rendered more happy in his work;
     and social prayer, which were he alone must be omitted,
     will also help to keep up in him, as well as in us, proper
     feelings as well as right views. I shall benefit by his
     conversation, and learn som what of the altered state of
     society in England, as all I hear leads me to conclude. Our
     mutual official duties may b  more readily effected, and
     the plans of the various Societies carried forward.‚Äù

The following notice of passing events, as given in the sam  letter,
may not be without interest:--

     ‚ÄúYou would be delighted to see how crowded the Old Church
     now is. Yesterday the Bishop preached there. The city is
     now divided into parishes, and each is to have its own
     vestry, and care of its own poor. Yesterday a sermon was
     preached, and 1753 Rs. collected for the poor of the Old
     Church district.... The Bishop has confirmed 317 persons,
     which, considering that a confirmation was held in June,
     1828, shews a rapid increase of population.‚Äù

On the 18th of February 1830, the Archdeacon and his wife went to
reside at the palace as the Bishop‚Äôs inmates; and the following
memorandum, which occurs under that date, in his private Journal,
does but reiterate the sentiments contained in the preceding letter:--

     ‚ÄúWe have to-day entered on a new course, by taking up our
     abode with the Bishop, on his invitation. It has been
     the subject of much anxiety with us, and of prayer. The
     reasons which determined us to this step are these:--1st.
     The Bishop‚Äôs kind invitation:--His loneliness from the
     departure of Mr. Carter; and the hope that our being here,
     may help to keep up the habits of domestic religion to
     which he had for some time been accustomed. 2nd. On our
     own part, the desire to benefit by his conversation and
     extensive acquirements; and to be workers together in the
     progress of improvement, both in and out of the Established
     Church, especially in the work of missions. 3rd. As it
     respects our usefulness in society, we shall be prevented
     shewing hospitality to the sam  extent as formerly; and if
     it should prevent any of our young friends, who are aiming
     at improvement in personal piety, from visiting us, the
     change will be unfavourable; but it will, also, cut us off
     from much unprofitable visiting and expence, to which,
     of late years, we have been much exposed, and by which I
     have been much tried. 4th. We shall be much more under
     restraint than in our own separate dwelling; but shall at
     the sam  time see more of each other, and for this we have
     been sighing for years past. O that we may but be enabled
     to improve the opportunities afforded, to our mutual growth
     in every gift, and especially in the love of the Saviour,
     as well as those things which make for our everlasting
     peace! For this we are insufficient of ourselves. May the
     grace of Christ rest upon us, and then shall we prosper!‚Äù

During the year 1829 an edition of the Book of Common Prayer in
Hindoostanee having been printed by the Calcutta Corresponding
Committee of the Prayer-Book and Homily Society, under the
superintendence of Archdeacon Corrie, he forwarded a copy of that
important work to England, for the purpose of having it presented to
the public library in Cambridge. His reason for doing this is thus
stated in a letter, of March 5, 1830,


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúI have been led to do this from our Bishop taking the
     trouble to send a copy to the Bodleian Library at Oxford.
     If it be worthy of a place in the one, as the Bishop
     thinks, it may be equally so of a place at Cambridge.‚Äù

The history of a work by means of which the Services of the Church
of England were first made accessible to the Native christians of
Hindoostan, may not here be omitted, especially as that history
has been supplied by the Archdeacon himself. To the Secretary of
the Calcutta Corresponding Committee of the Prayer-Book and Homily
Society, he writes

     ‚ÄúWhen I began this edition of the Book of Common Prayer in
     Hindoostanee,[151] it was at first intended to have altered
     very little from the Compendium, printed by the Prayer Book
     and Homily Society in London, but a near adherence to that
     model was soon found impracticable. I will here state, that
     the above Compendium, which is usually ascribed to the late
     Rev. H. Martyn, was the fruit of my own labour fifteen
     years ago, and that with very inadequate help. It seems but
     due to that eminent scholar, that I should publicly avow
     this, as his translation of the New Testament, shows how
     inferior the Compendium of the Prayer Book is to his style,
     and how altogether unworthy of his fame. The Compendium
     however, has answered an important purpose; the want of
     something of the kind was so much felt by many native
     christians, that it was eagerly adopted by them, and its
     imperfections even have gained currency among them.

     ‚ÄúIt was at first intended, also to have printed a small
     portion only of the new edition, with a view to collect
     the opinions of competent persons, respecting the
     execution; but the difficulty of obtaining such opinions,
     from the complete occupation of the time of every public
     Functionary in his official duties, is well known; and
     the delay that must inevitably arise on that plan, to the
     accomplishment of a work much needed, seemed to urge the
     necessity of making the most of present time, and of using
     the assistance providentially supplied, whilst it could
     be had. On this account the whole of the Book of Common
     Prayer, including every part of the Rubric and Articles
     of Religion, has been printed. The State Prayers, as they
     are usually called, are not included, nor the Psalms:
     the latter, are printed separately by the Auxiliary Bible
     Society, and can be supplied in that form to congregations
     prepared to use them. After the translation was finished,
     the native assistants were necessarily retained, till the
     work should be carried through the Press: this afforded
     opportunity for translating the Ordination Services also,
     and 100 copies were printed. Of the whole Book three
     hundred copies have been printed; and to 100 copies of
     these are added the Ordination Services. These, it may be
     said, are not likely soon to be brought into use, but that
     seems no reason why the mode adopted by our Church, in
     these services, and the scriptural sentiments they breathe,
     should not be laid open to the natives of this country.
     Besides these complete copies, 1000 copies of the Psalter
     have been printed for more general distribution. Owing to
     my absence from Calcutta, more of the Occasional Offices
     were added than is usual in such a Compendium; but though
     a little more expence has thus been incurred, the work is
     more valuable. One thousand copies, also, of the Morning
     and Evening Prayers and Litany, with the occasional Prayers
     and Thanksgivings, have been printed in Nagree, for the
     benefit of Christians who use only that character.

     ‚ÄúIt seems necessary to state, that some English terms
     have been retained, an explanation of them being given
     in parenthesis, where they are first used. On this point
     there will probably be a difference of opinion, but as the
     English terms are familiar to Native Christians connected
     with the British; and th     ds, Sacrament, Baptism, and
     such like, derived from the Latin Scriptures, are used by
     the numerous Roman Catholic Christians of this country, the
     retaining of them in the Prayer Book, is at least useful to
     these classes, whilst it is obvious, that th     ds, Lent,
     Whit-sunday, and some others, do not at all explain the
     events they are used to distinguish, and a    d common to
     several classes of christians, and to which they all attach
     the same meaning, may as well be used as any other, whilst
     it tends to unite them by a common phraseology.

     ‚ÄúThe assistance I have received from a person brought up
     in the country, and well versed in the writers, both in
     Persian and Hindoostanee, most esteemed by learned natives,
     allows me to hope that th  translation, generally, is
     likely to bear the test of candid criticism. The chief
     objection which I anticipate, arises from the difficulty
     of clothing many ideas peculiarly Christian, in popular
     language. The natives of this country, at the same
     time, generally have the ideas themselves to acquire,
     and the christian teacher may therefore as readily
     explain the meaning of an appropriate term, as, by using
     circumlocutions, lower the standa d of the language and
     keep his people in a low state of mental cultivation.
     I will only add that often the attaching a shade of
     difference to the meaning of a    d, would lead to a
     conclusion unfavourable to the translator, without cause: I
     am at the same time aware, that improvements may be made in
     the work, and hope, if life and opportunity be vouchsafed,
     to bring forth hereafter a more perfect edition.‚Äù

In the same letter to his brother, which is referred to above, the
Archdeacon states

     ‚ÄúOur affairs here go on in one uniform course of public
     grumbling, and private discontent. All who are touched by
     the retrenchments of Government, think they have cause to
     complain, and the army are certainly hardly used. But I try
     to have little to say in these matters. Missionary matters
     and education, supply sufficient employment without going
     into politics. We would fain make faster progress, but
     sickness, and obstacles arising from climate, hinder us;
     and we must be content to follow the course of Providence,
     and not to force it.

     ‚ÄúYou will have heard through Sherer, that we have become
     part of the Bishop‚Äôs household. I find his conversation
     very improving: he is naturally cheerful, and our
     intercourse is easy and agreeable. A part of his plan
     is to constitute his Archdeacons, his commissaries,
     and to delegate to them the details of the respective
     Archdeaconries. I continue, therefore, a Bishop _in
     partibus_ still, and having such opportunities of reference
     to the Bishop on all occasions, I am not likely to commit
     the interests of the church. The only point on which I
     differ from the Bishop, is on the policy of allowing
     Missionaries to engage in English duties. This is a far
     easier employment, than proper missionary work, and it
     is, moreover, a misapplication of Missionary funds. It
     will also prevent, I fear, the East India Company, from
     contributing as they ought, to the support of a ministry
     for their christian subjects.

     ‚ÄúI scarcely know what part of our history here will most
     interest you. The abolition of Suttee will no doubt be
     hea d of all over Europe. The last year prese     a return
     of 800 widows, and upward, consigned to the fire in this
     presidency. Of these upwards of 600 took place in Bengal;
     so that in this one province the strength of the practice
     lay. A considerable sensation has therefore been felt in
     Calcutta, but no where else. At Benares, Suttees have been
     even prevented, and th  poor widow (glad no doubt) retired      quietly home, saying, Such was her fate. What has been said
     against th  abolition in Calcutta, has been chiefly by
     some of the most wealthy. They are not, however, united;
     arguments pro and con are discussed among themselves, with
     great freedom, and no little acrimony, and they exhibit
     the spectacle of a family divided against itself. I wish
     you were more of a politician. We require on the renewal
     of the East India Company‚Äôs charter, that some further
     expression of public opinion should be shown, on the
     subject of christian education. Years ago, Mr. Wilberforce
     obtained that 100,000 rupees should be appropriated towards
     the moral improvement of this people by education. The
     said sum is indeed appropriated, but it is to Mahomedan and
     Hindoo learning, such as it is: now what is required is,
     that Christian education should also have a share of the
     public support.‚Äù

The following letter to Mr. Sherer, about the same date, supplies
some interesting particulars connected with the state of society in
Calcutta.

     ‚ÄúWe have been now nearly a month in the Bishop‚Äôs house.
     Our mode of life is as follows: prayers at eight o‚Äôclock,
     when the bishop sometimes expounds; and again, also, at
     half past nine o‚Äôclock in the evening. We breakfast after
     prayers; have _tiffin_[152] at two o‚Äôclock, dinner at half
     past six or seven. One evening, (Friday) any person who is
     not afraid of the Bible, is welcome to come in at eight
     o‚Äôclock, and after tea the Bishop reads and expounds, and
     dismisses us with prayer. In the season of Lent, the Bishop
     catechizes in the Cathedral, on Wednesday mornings, and
     preaches in the evening on Fridays. He is frequently at
     the Thursday evening lecture. He visited lately with me at
     Burdwan, and takes a lively interest in Missions; preaches
     in Bishop‚Äôs College Chapel, on Sunday evenings, to the few
     students and others, and enters much into the affairs of
     that institution. A Chapel is commenced at the free school,
     and a Mariner‚Äôs Church at the custom-house is preparing,
     and the building of a Church at Howrah is in progress. A
     form of an association for the better observance of the
     Lord‚Äôs day has been drawn up by the Bishop, and sent to the
     Chaplains, and all the dissenting Ministers; and yesterday,
     sermons were preached in all the Churches and Chapels
     here, on the duty of sanctifying the Sabbath. From these
     particulars, you will judge what spirit h     of. In our
     habitual intercourse he is cheerful, communicative, and      instructive; and hitherto, all has gone on very happily,
     with every promise of continuing to do so. Among the
     changes the Bishop has brought about is, the establishment
     of charitable committees connected with each church. They
     have been in operation above a month, and promise much
     good, both from the prevention of imposition, and the right
     appropriation of charity.

     ‚ÄúThe Hindoo College is working faster than its present
     supporters wish. The youths are growing up free-thinkers;
     and lately, some of them partook of a feast with one of the
     infidel christian teachers. The thing got wind, and th 
     parents (one a Brahmin) became alarmed. An inquiry was set
     on foot, and th  thing hushed up, but a strict injunction
     issued, that religion in any shape should not be mentioned      to the pupils. It has occurred to me that these high and
     rich Hindoos, may soon find th mselves obliged to urge the
     Government to pass a regulation, that loss of caste may
     not deprive individuals of property. A pro-suttee party is
     set on foot. Radah Cant Deb and others being members. They
     call themselves th  _Dhurm Soubah_ (which, as you have been
     so so long away, I may translate for you) ‚Äúthe righteous
     association;‚Äù but they have already fallen out about a
     treasurer: and strong recriminations are published, which
     promise little co-operation among them.

     ‚ÄúO how greatly do    need steady good men at Mirzapore.
     The situation of the mission-premises is becoming more and
     more important. All the modern reformed Hindoos reside in
     that quarter; and a man of fair attainments and attractive
     character placed there, might become a mighty instrument of
     good. Well: no doubt the right person will be forthcoming
     in the right time.‚Äù

As explanatory of the labours of Bishop Turner, mentioned above,
it may not be out of place to state, that of late years European
paupers had increased to such an extent in Calcutta, that not
only had the charitable funds in the hands of the Select Vestry
at the Cathedral, become inadequate to meet the exigencies of the
distressed, but frauds had been practised with such facility on the
charitable part of the community, that it became necessary to provide
for the fuller investigation of the cases of applicants for relief.
To remedy these evils a ‚ÄúCharitable Society‚Äù was formed at the
suggestion of the Bishop, which was carried on by a Central Committee
of Superintendance aided by subordinate Committees, corresponding
in number with the ecclesiastical districts into which Calcutta was
divided.

It will be seen, also, by the following memorandum, dated April 10,
1830, that the Archdeacon, for his part, had not been unmindful of
the necessity of labouring for the public good, though his success
seems to have fallen short of his wishes.

     ‚ÄúIn reviewing the past year, much cause, both for
     humiliation and for gratitude appears. In my own
     experience, a sense of defect and failure cannot but be
     felt. I can see nothing accomplished either in a public
     or private view. Nothing have I attained but to know more
     deeply that I am nothing, and must be indebted wholly to
     grace: yea, to grace pardoning grievous despite, leaping
     over opposition, and ‚Äòcarrying off the prey,‚Äô without
     corresponding effort on my part to fall in with grace.
     In public I attempted [to establish] a school for the
     country-born. The scheme was too large; and, in yielding
     this point to N----, my own folly appears. I failed also
     with Howrah, through the opposition of unreasonable men.
     But both these objects are likely to be attained by the
     Bishop: and in this ‚ÄòI rejoice.‚Äô Let good but be effected,
     and ‚ÄòI will rejoice.‚Äô Other schemes I had in mind for the
     furtherance and establishment of the gospel, which are
     approved by the Bishop; especially the plan of endowments,
     in which I hope something may be accomplished. I have been
     much tried in respect of Mirzapore. Expectations from the
     school baffled and likely to fail, from the failure (for
     so it is in fact) of R. Missionary prospects much clouded,
     from the lack of instruments. Yet doubtless the working is
     advancing, and the gospel is spreading. These are matters
     of much thought with me.... If I could, with propriety,
     withdraw to a quiet missionary station, my mind would
     have what at all times seems best for it; but to withdraw
     from a post to which I have been called, without a clear
     dispensation leading to it, would embitter such a plan. I
     see nothing for it, but patiently to abide in my present
     situation, and to wait till affairs indicate what I ought      to do. May I only be preserved from giving offence in my
     public or private capacity; and may I have grace to improve
     opportunities of working in th  service of the gospel!‚Äù

But notwithstanding this somewhat dispirited view of the results of
his labours, the hopes of the Archdeacon respecting the establishing
of a school for the country-born, seemed about to be realized so
soon as that important project was taken in hand by the Bishop. In
a letter which the Archdeacon wrote on the 23rd of April 1830, he
observes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúI wrote to you some time since respecting a project for
     a school in this city. We are still busy about it, and
     not without hopes of succeeding in establishing it. Great
     obstacles, however, occur. Our Government just now is too
     much on the Utilitarian system; which seems to mean, ‚ÄòThat
     every one must do the best he can for himself, seeing
     that no aid is to be afforded.‚Äô One thing this will work,
     which for this country will prove beneficial, whatever
     it may prove to Old England--   will render this country
     independent of England. It is well, certainly, that the
     resources of this country, both individual and general,
     should be called forth, and with a little forbearing care,
     they might for ages be auxiliary to the mother-country; but
     by refusing present aid, unkind feelings are called forth,
     and where no obligation is conferred on the one hand, no
     gratitude is felt on the other.‚Äù

The letter in which the preceding observations are contained, was
not finished until the 11th of May, under w     date the Archdeacon
adds:--

     ‚ÄúNothing further has occurred here worth remarking,
     except that a master has unexpectedly turned up for the
     Grammar-School. Pray do you ever think of India in a
     political point of view? How the charter is constituted,
     or whether it can be altered for the better? We seem to
     want some attention from home; and I would fain hope we
     shall get it now the charter is again to be discussed. We
     are under the regulations of the Government as to abode.
     If one would establish a school, or promote education
     in any way, we are liable to be banished to England, if
     Government should not happen to like our project; and, if
     it does, we must ask leave to pay the expences out of our
     own pockets, for not a Rupee will Government give: and yet
     in this presidency alone, seven millions sterling are drawn
     annually from the land, and as much more from monopolies
     of salt, and opium, and from certain duties! Is none of
     this to be laid out otherwise than to promote increased
     dividends in Leadenhall Street?‚Äù

An able head-master having thus been obtained in th  person of the
Rev. J. Macqueen, it was determined on th  4th of June 1830, to
establish the ‚ÄúCalcutta High School,‚Äù on a plan arranged by Bishop
Turner. To provide for the educational department, it was proposed
to raise a sum of money by transferable shares, which were to bear
interest arising from dividends of profits; th  shares to be paid by
instal       and the proceeds to be vested in th  names of certain
Trustees. A Committee of management and visitors was appointed, and
such regulations agreed upon as were calculated to give efficiency
and stability to the school. But that at which the Archdeacon chiefly
aimed was, if possible to obtain from Government, or the benevolence
of individuals, an endowment for the School. But the little prospect
there was of assistance from th  former source will be collected from
a letter written by the Archdeacon


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                  ‚ÄúJune 17, 1830.

     ‚ÄúOur increased acquaintance with the Bishop renders us more
     at home with him, and we see more to admire in him. He is
     by far best suited for this appointment of any who have
     occupied it. With more practical knowledge of men, and of
     parochial matters than any of them, he has large views of
     usefulness; and, with perfect propriety of language, states
     them to Government. Had we a man who had any fixed views
     of Government at      ead of affairs, something effectual
     might be accomplished for the religious welfare of India,
     but when ---- is on one hand, and ---- on the other, of
     Government, what can be expected but fancies and crudities?
     And such seem most of the public acts at present.

     ‚ÄúI may mention to you that in a Report on Ecclesiastical
     affairs lately made up by the Finance Committee, the
     employment of missionaries generally, without regard to
     class, and Roman Catholic priests, was recommended, to
     prevent increase of chaplains; and the principle broadly
     affirmed, that Government is not bound to supply the means
     of grace to any besides the European troops, to which the
     charter binds them. This gave opportunity to state other
     views and principles, which must have surprised certain
     persons not a little. You need not be surprised, should you
     hear of the Bishop‚Äôs arrival in England a few months hence;
     as it is quite evident, that should the Home Government
     depend on the information derived from this quarter,
     nothing will be done for us in an ecclesiastical point of
     view; and twenty more years of this miserable system [will]
     be perpetrated, which can only end in confusion al ost
     irremediable.‚Äù

     DISQUIETUDE CONCERNING THE ANGLO-HINDOO COLLEGE--DEATH OF BISHOP
       TURNER.


On th  20th of June, 1830, Archdeacon Corrie left Calcutta in
company with the Bishop, with a view to attend that Prelate in a
visitation of the Upper Provinces. They proceeded, however, only
as far as Chunar, circumstances having decided the Bishop to defer
his Visitation of Delhi and the intermediate Stations. The Bishop
and Archdeacon, th refore, returned to the Presidency by the latter
end of September. One result of this journey was, to create a
greater anxiety than ever in th  mind of the Archdeacon, that in the
contemplated renewal of the East India Company‚Äôs Charter, some more
efficient provision should be made for the spiritual wa    of India,
than had hitherto been th  case. On that important subject h  writes,


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                         ‚ÄúCalcutta, Oct. 6, 1830.

     ‚ÄúThe times are troublous both at home and abroad;
     discontent is spread through every branch of this service,
     in many cases unreasonably, in many the privations actually
     inflicted cause much distress. Your political atmosphere
     seems very cloudy;--what may follow the death of George
     IV. we dare not conjecture. It affects my mind especially,
     with reference to the renewal of the East India Company‚Äôs
     charter. ‚ÄòThe Lord reigneth,‚Äô might well serve on this
     head, as on the affairs of England; but I have no call to
     interf re in th  latter, whereas I must plead for India.
     Do, beloved brother, look about for aid in this matter;
     affairs h re in reference to religion are more and more
     pressing. The young civilians are now sent out of Calcutta
     soon after their arrival, qualified or not, so that at    
     small stations, th re are more than formerly. You will
     remember that out-of-the-way place Azimgurh: th re are five
     civilians, three young officers, and a doctor, with the
     usual _Cranies_:[153] such is the general increase at our
     Stations. Now, a Chaplain at each of such stations, is too
     much at present to expect, but such a number as would admit
     of a Chaplain from Benares, Gazeepore, or Gorruckpore,
     visiting th  subordinat  stations at stated intervals,
     might and ought to be allowed. Instead of this, it is
     recommended from this [Government], to reduce the present
     number of Chaplains to seven, and to secure the occasional
     services of Missionaries, of any and every persuasion, and
     to abolish the Scotch establishment altogether. Our House
     of Commons seems indeed at a low ebb. From what a height
     of splendour, in eloquence and lofty feelings at least,
     is Parliament fallen. I look in vain for an advocate for
     poor India, in all that passes,--at least as reported
     h re. Perhaps a dissolution of Parliament may bring to
     light some ‚Äògem of purer ray;‚Äô though it is rather to
     be feared lest India be lost sight of amidst contending
     politics at home. I can tell you in confidence, that our
     Bishop has represented to the powers h re, that by such
     a scheme of Church arrangeme    as above, Government
     would recognise Missions, which they have never done;
     have no control over the agents so authorised; and tha        by a variety of procedure in those employed, confusion
     probably would ensue. Whereas if they are serious in
     their attempts to extend sound knowledge, by extending
     the Church establishment, and taking more pains than at
     present to secure fit persons, th y might provide a body
     of most efficient agents in forwarding the improvement of
     the country. I need not tell you, except to refresh your
     memory, that w re a Clergyman of respectable character
     and attainme    placed at Krishnaghur, and every oth r
     Sudder[154] Station, the indigo-planters would in time
     avail th mselves of his services, by coming in with their
     families at     Festivals, or receiving occasional visits
     at their houses; besides, th re might be a school under
     hi  own eye at home. Would not many of the planters be
     induced to establish a school each, which the Chaplain
     would occasionally visit, &c.? All this has been stated
     to the Governor General, who at     time is friendly, but
     is hopeless as to the Court of Directors. Our Bishop is
     of opinion that w re th  subject taken up judiciously at
     home, by a person not suspected of party spirit; and the
     Bishop of London, and Archbishop, who are both desirous of
     India‚Äôs religious welfare, w re judiciously instructed how
     to proceed, and fully and truly informed of the state of
     things h re,--that     Duke of Portland, for instance, and
     many in high places would join in furthering an extension
     of Church establishment, _along with other_ measures. The
     subject taken up singly, our Bishop fears, would not find
     sufficient patronage. I have said all I can, to urge our
     Bishop to go home himself. It would, I know, be a venturing
     of everything, and myself, perhaps, durst not, w re I in
     his place, make the venture, yet circumstances seem to call
     for it.

     ‚ÄúA controversy has arisen on the subject of missionary
     exertions, most unexpectedly. The whole history is in
     point. I will send it to you by Captain J. next w ek. The
     missionary of the Scotch General Assembly, and Mr. Hill,
     opened a Lecture in a house in the square, opposite to the
     Hindoo College: some of the youths attended; the College
     council forbad them!‚Äù

The history h re referred to, is too instructive to be omitted.
It appears that not only serious christians, but the friends of
morality and social order generally, and many of the pare    of the
students in the Hindoo College, had become alarmed at observing,
that whilst th  system of education pursued in the College was
subverting th  pupils‚Äô faith in Hindooism, it was substituting no
oth r faith instead. Many of the students, in fact, w re becoming
sceptics, others downright atheists. To obviat , if it might be, the
mischievous consequences likely to result from such an education
as that, it was determined to give the students an opportunity for
becoming acquainted with the evidences of Natural and Revealed
religion. In order to this, Mr. Duff, the Missionary of the Scotch
church, having offered the use of his rooms for th  purpose, Mr.
James Hill, one of the Missionaries of the London Society, began a
course of lectures on the evidences of religion; and many of the
students of the Hindoo College attended. The subjects discussed
w re exclusively religious, and w re listened to with marked
attention. But no sooner did it reach the ears of the Managers of
the Anglo-Indian College that    se lectures w re attended by some
of the students, than that attendance was prohibited by a public
order; as if Christianity w re th  only religion that ought not to
have a h aring. It was stated at     time, in excuse for such of the
managers of the College as w re Europeans, that    y had signed the
order of prohibition with a great degree of reluctance, and only
because some of the pare    of the students had required the council
to interfere;--but it was not easy to understand how the interdicting
of those Students from listening to Christian missionaries, could
be distinguished from an act of religious persecution. With regard
to the principle on which the Hindoo College was carried on, it was
stated by Archdeacon Corrie in a letter to Mr. Sh rer, that at    
first interview which the Archdeacon had with Lord William Bentinck,
he was led to observe to his Lordship that     College was breeding
up a race of Infidels and Philosophers so called; and that the first
petition for a Colonial council would probably come from thence.

The same subject forms a prominent portion of a letter, in the
following month,


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                         ‚ÄúCalcutta, Nov. 4, 1830.

     ‚ÄúI wish sometimes I could have an hour‚Äôs conversation
     with you, for I know not how to set about writing all you
     would like to hear. Ram Mohun Roy is a passenger in the
     Albion. It is said he is become a Fakeer, and does not
     lose caste by this proceeding. He has not called on the
     pr sent Bishop. The Hindoo college is working th  ruin of
     caste; and, unless better principles be insinuated, the
     ruin of British int rests. Miss B. visited the college
     last w ek, and examined one of the classes in history.
     She asked about America, and was informed very accurately
     of its form of government, with high commendations of the
     limited pow r of the President; and also of the office
     being elective. On being asked if this had always been
     the condition [of that country,] ‚ÄòIt was answ red, ‚ÄúThat
     they w re formerly a Colony of England, but that on being
     taxed excessively,    y had taken upon them the governing
     of themselves, as,‚Äù said the youth, ‚Äúwe shall one day do.‚Äù
     To the question, of what religion w re th  Americans?‚Äô
     It was answ red, ‚ÄòProtestant christians generally, and
     that Unitarianism was making rapid progress among th m.‚Äô
     Mr. Duff, the Scotch Missionary, goes a good deal into
     the debating Societies, which these Bengalees have
     established lately among th mselves. Politics and religion
     are excluded from the subjects of discussion, but when
     discoveries in science or government happen to come up;
     France is eulogised unboundedly, and America; but England,
     if referred to, always depr ciat d. Thus our Rulers are
     pr paring a scourge for th ir own backs.... I hope, too,
     the counteracting influence is at work. Mr. Duff has a
     school of upwards of 200, in the Chitpore road, in the
     house where first the Anglo-Hindoo College was held. The
     Methodist missionaries have established themselves in
     that street, a little below the Nietta Bazaar, and have
     a school of 115 Portuguese boys, and also some girls;
     and are collecting a Congregation of that class. We have
     seventy boys at Mirzapore; and now a regular congregation
     of upwards of thirty Christians. Mrs. Wilson goes on as
     usual; and a school is, I hope, in a fair way of being
     permanently established on the ruins of the Grammar School.
     It is called the ‚ÄòHigh school,‚Äô and has ninety scholars,
     country-born. A very energetic master is at the head of it.
     A Mariners‚Äô Church has been fitted up just behind Fairlie
     and Co‚Äôs. house in the Strand. The attendance of sailors
     has not yet been large, but we hope the place is gaining
     attention.‚Äù

Soon after the date of the foregoing Letter, the Archdeacon was
attacked by fever, which almost incapacitated him for attending to
any public duty. The transition, from the hot to the cold season,
was this y    so sudden as to cause great unhealthiness in Calcutta.
The Archdeacon complained, in his correspondence, of feeling great
debility, and an ‚Äúinefficiency arising from lengthened residence in
that wasting climate.‚Äù It was during this sickness that the following
memorandum was penned:--

     ‚ÄúNov. 21, 1830. I have had much meditation of late on
     the inward witness of the Spirit, as a part of christian
     experience which few cultivate as they ought. Besides
     the acknowledging of the truth of God‚Äôs word,    re must
     be an acquaintance with, and belief of its contents; and
     the experience of it as influencing our tempers and every
     action. Without this latter, there can be no ‚Äòassuring of
     our hearts before him.‚Äô May I be enabled to realise this
     latter truth, and persevere in seeking such realising views
     of God‚Äôs mercy in Christ, as shall enable me to say, ‚ÄòHe
     _loved me_, and gave Himself _for me_! With this witness
     I shall be enabled to pass on the few years that seem to
     remain, with more courage, d cision, and usefulness.‚Äù

It was not till the middle of January 1831, that Archdeacon Corrie
recov red some degree of health. Then it was that he writes,


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                               ‚ÄúJanuary 15, 1831.

     ‚ÄúWe are, through God‚Äôs goodness, in our usual health again.
     I had been ill since the beginning of Novemb r with a cold,
     and for a time, with fever. The news from France[155] has
     given occasion to balls and dinners, and speeches at the
     Town-Hall h re:--may excesses be pr vented, and may the
     liberty obtained for Divine truth, be used for extension
     through the whole continent of Europe. Doubtless, ‚ÄòThe
     time of the end is coming,‚Äô but what its distinct features
     will be, I think the Scriptures do not define, except as
     to the righteousness and peace that shall pr vail. H re
     truth advances with slow steps, but it is on the advance,
     doubtless.... Missions are every where receiving additions
     to their converts, though you know how little as y t the
     people can be said to be interest d.‚Äù


                             TO THE SAME.

                                              ‚ÄúFebruary 24, 1831.

     ‚ÄúMissionary work looks more encouraging than I have ever
     known it here. The classes are adding to th ir numb rs,
     especially in the villages to the south and west of
     Calcutta: at a village called Rass-poonjee twelve miles
     south east, the Church Missionary Society has a school. I
     was there on Monday last with our Missionary ladies. There
     are about fifty children, and a new movement appears in
     sixteen adults formed into an exercising school to learn
     to read. The school-house was filled with people, who
     listened very seriously, in several instances, with marks
     of approbation: whilst, through a native Christian who
     understands English, I set before them the fall of man, and
     the means of his restoration to God and happiness.

     ‚ÄúMrs. C. and I went to Burdwar last week.... We staid a
     week with the V‚Äôs. Twenty-two of the European residents
     attended the communion on Sunday. Among them your shipmate,
     M. S. who is judge there. A gratifying fact was established
     from considerable observation,--that not an individual
     educated in the Mission-schools, has been brought as a
     culprit before the magistrate there. The D‚Äôs have also
     120 girls in four schools. I was grieved to observe
     that amongst these favourable appearances t  re are few
     instances of conversion so d ep as one could wish. The
     natives see the temporal advantage of being under a sahib‚Äôs
     protection, and though sufferings connected with loss of
     caste are, to a degree, unavoidable, o   r benefits accrue
     to them. This is evidently favourable to the general
     diffusion of Christian knowledge, but we need greatly, more
     of the Holy Spirit‚Äôs grace. This has set us on a union in
     prayer, after the method proposed by Mr. Brown in 1802. I
     will send you soon some of the ‚Äòproceedings.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúA newspaper called ‚ÄòThe Reformer,‚Äô has been s t on foot by
     natives, in English, of which four (weekly) numb rs have
     appeared, which I will also send you. ‚ÄòThe schoolmaster
     is abroad,‚Äô but, as I have stated before, the influence
     at work in the ‚ÄòReformer,‚Äô and all in that connexion, is
     anti-English, and Christian only, as it cannot help being
     so.[156] But you will be glad to hear that a lecture on
     ‚ÄòMorals,‚Äô is proposed for the Hindoo College.‚Äù

Then after referring to some of the religious movements which have
already been mentioned, the Archdeacon adds,

     ‚ÄúWith all these favourable appearances, you will understand
     that many perplexities arise in the detail of things. The
     truth of that saying often appears--‚Äòthat if Christianity
     were not divine, its own friends would prov  its ruin.‚Äô It
     may not appear so manifest at home, but h re, where the
     contrast between truth and error is so marked, the errors
     of those holding the truth work much evil.... Would that
     we had some addition to the ‚Äòmoral strength,‚Äô as Lord
     Wellesley used to call it, of our department! What will
     the new Charter produce? H  who knoweth the end from the
     beginning, is well aware; and knoweth how to overrule all
     to his own glory! O for a stronger faith to look within the
     veil, and to credit what the Saviour saith bo   in respect
     to one‚Äôs self and the world at large! I know not how it is
     with you, but I cannot but feel that the evening of life
     is drawing on; and the expectation of escaping from these
     uncertainties to the possession of eternal realities, is at
     times welcome.‚Äù

The ‚Äúunion in prayer,‚Äù to which the Archdeacon here ref rs, was the
result of a meeting of Clergymen, held at his suggestion, in the
Old Church rooms in Calcutta, on the 28th of the preceding month,
‚Äúto take into consideration the propriety of uniting in prayer, and
engaging others to do so, for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.‚Äù It
seemed to himself, and others conversant with India, that the state
of religion among professing christians, and the widely extended
ignoranc   nd error of heathen nations, were such as to call forth
the sympathies of all who desired to further the prosperity of the
Church of Christ, and the conversion of the world. Considering,
however, that it is only by the Almighty power and grac  of God the
Holy Ghost, that ‚Äúth  whole church is governed and sanctified,‚Äù
and that the preaching of the Gospel is in an age or country made
effectual to the conversion and salvation of those who hear, it was
agreed by the Archdeacon and his clerical friends, to set apart
individually a stated portion of time for the purpose of praying
God ‚Äúth  Father, that for Christ‚Äôs sake, He would pour His Spirit
upon all flesh.‚Äù They agreed, also, to engage their congregations
and friends, as much as possible, to unite with them severally in
prayer, at the same stated time and for the same great object.
The resolutions agreed upon at the meeting were subscribed by the
Archdeacon and the ot  r Clergymen, and w re embodied in a circular,
in which also w re pointed out the special objects for which the
influences of the Holy Spirit should be sought. This circular
seems to have been reprinted, and made the subject of supercilious
animadversions in some of the Calcutta newspapers. Nor wa    at
matter for surprise; since persons who had deluded themselves with
the belief that scienc   nd merely secular education, were alone
sufficient to make man what God would have him to be, could not be
expected to understand and enter into the convictions of those
who regarding the grac  and influence of the Holy Ghost to be
essential to the true civilization of the world, prayed and laboured
accordingly.

The allusion by the Archdeacon to the ‚Äúerrors of those who held the
truth,‚Äù was called forth by the circumstance that some in India
had been uns ttled by a Treatise on Faith, written by Mr. Thomas
Erskine, a Scotch advocate, and which had recently reached Calcutta.
This book, though of but ephemeral existence, seems to have produced
discussion at the time, and excited in the Archdeacon some fears
lest it should have diverted the attention of his friends from the
great truths which accompany salvation. His own reflections on Mr.
Erskine‚Äôs opinions are contained in a memorandum, dated

     ‚ÄúApril 10, 1831. To-day I have attained fifty-four years,
     and of these, twenty-nine spent in the ministry. In review
     of the past, chiefly unprofitableness and unfaithfulness
     is to be seen. My own defects are certainly becoming more
     apparent to myself: the fulness and freeness of the Gospel
     become increasingly glorious, and no  ing but full, free,
     unconditional forgiveness of all sin, and justification
     from all things, would meet my case. With ref rence to
     the past year, I do hope some progress has been made.
     Much enquiry has been stirred up by Erskine‚Äôs view of the
     Gospel: I have examined it with much anxiety, but see no
     reason to change my former views on that subject. Pardon
     is full and free to all who receive Christ, because life
     eternal is in Him; and whosoever receives Him cannot
     fail of life eternal, yea, possesses it with Him. There
     may be some occasion for Mr. E‚Äôs charge against some for
     referring exclusively to fruits as an evidence of faith.
     I think I have met with some who, whilst they acknowledge
     justification to be exclusively of faith, yet depend on
     works to justify their faith; and thus their dependence,
     after all, is on works. Such, as far as I know myself, is
     not my feeling.‚Äù

It has here to be stated that Bishop Turner had quitted Calcutta at
the end of September 1830, with the intention of visiting the ot  r
Presidencies. His Lordship had proceeded overland from Madras to
Bombay, and from thence had gone to Ceylon. During his Visitation he
had maintained a regular correspondenc  with Archdeacon C. and seems
now to have been on his way back to Calcutta; for the Archdeacon
writes,


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                       ‚ÄúCalcutta, April 30, 1831.

     ‚ÄúOur kind Bishop is not yet returned, but we are expecting
     him daily. He left   lombo on the 4th for Jaffna, &c. to
     Madras; and thenc  by sea hither. He is much out of heart
     with Ceylon in every  ing but as respects Missionary work;
     and he say    at the Church Missionary Society has done,
     and is doing enough there, to answer all the expenditure
     ever incurred by it. I am desiring him back greatly, the
     times seeming to call for him here, for which his wisdom
     and pious liberality will, I hope, be found just suited.‚Äù

Then follow some instructive particulars respecting the Anglo-Hindoo
College.

     ‚ÄúThe Hindoo college you knew when yet in embryo, and
     your conclusion of an argument with H. M. is beginning
     to be realized, ‚ÄòWell, well, build away, and some will
     come after you who will use it in a proper manner.‚Äô The
     mode proceeded on, has succeeded in detaching many of the
     Hindoo youths from religion of every kind. In sentiment
     this has appeared for three or four years, it now begins
     to appear in practice. At the late East Indian dinner,
     sixteen Hindoo lads had bought tickets to go, actually
     determining to break through all restraints. This was
     however prevented; Sir E. R., Mr. C., and J. Y. were the
     means of preventing their young friends from doing this
     open violence to Hindoo feeling; but one youth of the
     Moterjee family has left his home, and taken a house,
     determined to live in European fashion. He was, also, about
     to marry a young woman of Portuguese origin, one of the
     De Rozio family, but this I am told is put off. The main
     mover in the meeting among the Hindoos is D., the poet.
     Mr. H. W. became so convinced of the need of morals to the
     Hindoo College system, that he proposed a moral philosophy
     lecture, and D. as the lecturer. W. B., who is one of the
     Committee of Public Education, let his colleagues, who had
     consented, know the character of D. and it was agreed best
     to postpone the appointment; and now D. is dismissed from
     the Hindoo College on a charge, by respectable Hindoos, of
     Atheism. He stoutly denied the charge; but they said, ‚ÄòWe
     see your works.‚Äô It is evident the English I have named,
     are at their wit‚Äôs end. The young men say, they will no
     longer be guilty of the hypocrisy of upholding Hindooism.
     Christianity they have been warned against as an English
     prejudice; and they seem to hate Christianity and England
     heartily. Their advisers now say, ‚ÄòWait for Ram Mohun Roy‚Äôs
     return.‚Äô In the mean time, some of the youths are gone
     to ot  r schools. Upwards of fifty have left the Hindoo
     College, six are entered at the High School. Mrs. Wilson
     has a party daily of from ten to fifteen who come expressly
     to read the Scriptures with her. One begged for an English
     Testament, Mrs. W. said, ‚ÄòYou can understand Bengalee
     better,‚Äô but, said she, ‚ÄòI dare not take a Bengalee one
     home. An English one my friends will not suspect, and I
     can read it at leisure.‚Äô Two come daily to Mr. Sandys
     at Mirzapore, professedly to be assisted in preparing
     their lessons; but they always also read the Bible. They
     are not of the first in wealth; that class seem to a man
     opposed to every t ing English. Not a movement in favour
     of religion in any form is heard of. This has arisen in a
     degree, from the part R. and his friends,[157] have been
     and are playing. They complain as if they had lost mighty
     privileges once in possession, and claim to be employed by
     the state, as a matter of right. This I t ink has arisen
     from Government having withheld all patronage from plans
     of Christian improvement. The little they are advanced
     above former days, is entirely through their own exertions.
     Yet two thirds of them are raised above the station their
     fathers held, and their pretensions are ridiculous. With
     them, however, the enlightened Hindoos seem disposed to
     make common cause. They can effect nothing at present,
     but the _impolicy_, not to say the sin, of withholding
     christian instruction is now beginning to appear.‚Äù

In a letter to Mr. Sherer of a somewhat later date, the Archdeacon
mentions ot  r incidents connected with the Hindoo College, which may
here be fitly related.

     ‚ÄúThe Hindoo College,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúhas borne some fruit,
     not agreeable to those who planted it. The young men are
     many of them licentious to a degree. The more moral of
     them are scoffers at all that is good. One very clever
     youth, after feasting with his friends on beef, &c. threw
     the bones into a neighbouring Brahmin‚Äôs compound.[158] The
     Brahmin and his friends attacked the convivial party, and a
     sad _fracas_ ensued. One of the lads comes often to me, and      I am not without hopes of him.‚Äù

Bishop Turner arrived in Calcutta on the 4th of May 1831, but he
was in a state of health, which excited much apprehension among his
friends. As also, his health continued to decline after his return
to Calcutta, a voyage to Penang and New South Wales was recommended,
in the hope that his valuable life might be prolonged; but the rapid
decay of the Bishop‚Äôs strength rendered it necessary for him to
abandon all thoughts of leaving home. On the 29th of June a still
furt  r change for the worse took place; so that Archdeacon Corrie
writes,


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                   ‚ÄúJuly 4, 1831.

     ‚ÄúI regret to say that our Bishop is in but a very
     indifferent state. He came back to us early in May
     unwell; and the debility has increased till hope of his
     continuance among us is well nigh taken away. His disease
     is some internal disarrangement. This was excited into
     activity by the fatigue and heat he had to endure whilst
     on his visitation of the ot  r Presidencies. He is dying,
     we fear, of debility, with occasional paroxysms of short
     breat ing.... I do not like to give up the hope of his
     living: though it would seem unbrot  rly under these
     circumstances, to let a ship go without acquainting you
     with our state. To me the loss would be the greatest I
     have experienced out of my own family. The kindness and
     confidence with which he has treated me, and the benefit
     I have derived from his conversation, must ever be deeply
     felt. To the Indian Church the loss will be greater than
     any yet suffered. He unites the best qualities of his
     predecessors, with the knowledge of the business of a
     clergyman, in the conducting of schools, management of
     charities, &c. &c. Just now [three P. M.] his medical
     attendant reports the Bishop worse. The Lord be gracious to
     this land, and bring light out of this darkness!‚Äù

Within three days of the date of this letter, the Indian church was
deprived for the fourth time of its chief Pastor, by the deat  of
Bishop Turner. Among the Archdeacon‚Äôs papers is the following account
of the last illness of the Bishop.

     ‚ÄúOn Saturday evening, the 2nd of July, the Bishop first
     spoke to me as if he were not to remain in India. After
     our evening drive I accompanied him up stairs, and he
     indicated a wish that I should sit down with him in the
     drawing-room. ‚ÄòHe was going to Penang,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòand if
     he did not recover there as he expected, should proceed
     to New South Wales. He now had seen enough of the Diocese
     to judge of the state of religion generally amongst us.
     He thought the state as favourable as, under present
     circumstances, he could well expect. He judged too it would
     be progressive. There is a sad deficiency of clergy, but,
     notwithstanding, many active agents are at work:‚Äô and he
     alluded to several laymen, especially officers, of whom he
     had spoken, as wisely and diligently attending to schools
     in different places he had visited. ‚ÄòThat no difficulties
     manifested themselves, at present, in the administration
     of ecclesiastical affairs, and that he should leave India
     without anxiety.‚Äô

     ‚Äú2. The Bishop had intended to have crossed the river next
     morning, in order to partake of the Lord‚Äôs Supper, in
     Bishop‚Äôs College Chapel. I was afraid he might not be able;
     and had made arrangements for the duty at Barrackpore,
     in order to remain with him: as I had, indeed, before,
     from his saying early in June, after he could not go to
     church, ‚Äòthese dull Sundays destroy me.‚Äô I had, therefore,
     remained at home two Sundays; and though he said nothing
     on the subject, I had the satisfaction to see that it was
     agreeable to him. On the evening of the 2nd, the Bishop
     said, ‚Äòhe felt it would be too much for him to cross the
     river;‚Äô and he gladly assented to my proposal to have
     communion at home, after my return from morning sermon,
     in the Old Church. Accordingly, about half-past-twelve,
     on Sunday, the 3rd, the Bishop, Mrs. Corrie, and Miss
     Bird, assembled in the drawing-room: preparations having
     been previously made. It was a very solemn occasion. He
     was able to kneel only whilst receiving the elements.
     After communicating, Mrs. Corrie left the room, being
     much moved, and unwilling to give him pain by shewing it.
     After a short pause, the Bishop said, ‚ÄòHow many blessings
     have we to be thankful for?‚Äô ‚ÄòI have often enjoyed these
     ordinances in administering them, but a person must be
     in my circumstances to feel the value of them.‚Äô ‚ÄòI have
     growing evidence that I know in whom I have trusted:‚Äô
     and then went on to contrast the uncertainty attending
     science, with the certainty religion supplies. ‚ÄòA little
     knowledge of science,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòmakes us confident; but
     as we advance, we feel less certainty; whilst the more we
     advance in religious knowledge, the greater certainty we
     attain.‚Äô I here left the room, and the Bishop continued in
     conversation with Miss B. for some time respecting family
     matters. In the evening, the Bishop retired, for the first
     time, before tea.

     ‚Äú3. On Monday, he did not leave his room; and his medical
     attendant being now in the house, I merely saw him twice,
     on going into his room to enquire after him. In the evening
     he went out in the _Tonjon_, and spoke to me, on the bank
     of the river, about a marriage which he had been consulted
     upon; but he was soon tired, and retired to his room,
     without coming into the drawing-room.

     ‚Äú4. On Tuesday, he did not leave his couch. I saw him
     early: he was very unwell; and his medical attendant being
     constantly with him, I did not go into the room again till
     about 4 P. M. He then requested me to make known to Mr.
     Robertson of Bareilly, the state of weakness into which
     it had pleased God to bring him. After which he said, ‚Äòhe
     enquired not after Mrs. Corrie, but he felt deeply the
     kindness she had uniformly manifested.‚Äô ‚ÄòHe desired his
     kind love to her; and that she should be told he felt his
     obligation.‚Äô On my saying that, ‚Äòhad he been able to come
     into the drawing-room, she had hoped to see him in the
     evening, and would be glad to come to his room:‚Äô he said
     with emotion, ‚Äòhe thought he would rather be spared.‚Äô
     ‚ÄòHe did not,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòspeak much to me on the state of
     the diocese; I knew it as well as he did, and in some
     respects better; and added, ‚ÄòI say with truth, I feel no
     reluctance to leave things as they are. There was nothing
     of importance claiming immediate attention, and should any
     difficulty arise, you will get over it.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúThe faithfulness of God to His word was referred to by
     him; and on my mentioning an expression of the late Rev. D.
     Brown, on his death-bed, viz. ‚ÄòThe Lord‚Äôs will is best. His
     way is best. His time is best.‚Äô The Bishop added, ‚Äòthat he
     greatly needed the intercession of his friends, that such
     might be his state of mind.‚Äô

     ‚Äú5. In the night of the 5th, [the Bishop] being restless,
     the doctor asked, ‚Äòif he would like me to come and sit
     beside him?‚Äô On his assenting, I was called; I went to
     his bed-side, he took me kindly by the hand and said, ‚Äòhe
     feared he interrupted me.‚Äô He then began to say, ‚Äòhow happy
     he should be, could he speak to the natives in their own
     tongue;‚Äô and referred to his head-bearer. I offered to
     speak to him in Hindoostanee; but the Bishop said, ‚Äònot
     now, he is fearfully untutored.‚Äô He spoke a good deal on
     subjects of religion, connected with his own state; of the
     insufficiency of learning, talents, &c. &c., without the
     blessing of God; how often God brings about great things
     by small means; and instruments we should not have thought
     of. After about an hour, he asked me to pray with him; then
     said, ‚Äòhe would try to compose himself to rest.‚Äô

     ‚Äú6. Wednesday, July 6th, was a day of intense and incessant
     suffering, from difficulty of breathing. He seemed unable
     to attend to any thing; but on Miss B. going into the room,
     he desired her to read to him a Psalm, and conversed about
     a quarter of an hour on points which occurred in reading.
     About 4 o‚Äôclock I went into his room: I observed, that ‚ÄòI
     feared he had had a trying day.‚Äô He said with emphasis,
     ‚Äò_Very._‚Äô

     ‚ÄúOn my saying, ‚Äòthat when he felt able to attend, if he
     would just express his wishes, I should be glad to wait
     upon him for prayer:‚Äô he assented. He after some time
     observed, in broken sentences, (for his articulation had
     become indistinct) ‚ÄòThat we do not arrange matters in
     religion sufficiently for ourselves.‚Äô More I could not
     understand. In order to keep up the train of thought, I
     said that ‚Äòour mercy consists in that the covenant is
     ordered in all things and sure.‚Äô He assented, and said,
     ‚Äòbut to those who were orderly there might be more of joy
     and peace in believing.‚Äô I said ‚Äòin great bodily distress,
     it seemed to me, there could be little beside a child-like
     reliance on a father‚Äôs care and love.‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòI have
     an assured hope:‚Äô and added, ‚Äòthat we want God to do some
     great thing for us, that shall prevent the necessity of
     humiliation, and closing with Christ.‚Äô After this I read
     a hymn, ‚ÄòJesus the way, the truth, the life.‚Äô He said,
     ‚Äòthat one feeling was universal, it pervaded all hearts.‚Äô
     In continuation I read the hymn, ‚ÄòThis God is the God we
     adore;‚Äô and then prayed out of the Visitation of the Sick,
     ending with the Lord‚Äôs prayer, and ‚ÄòThe grace of our Lord,
     &c.,‚Äô to which he added a fervent ‚ÄòAmen.‚Äô After a pause,
     the Bishop broke out in prayer: ‚ÄòO thou God of all grace,
     stablish, strengthen, settle us. Have mercy on all, that
     they may come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved.
     There is none other name given by which they _can_ be
     saved. Other foundation can no man lay.‚Äô On his ceasing,
     I added, ‚Äòand this is a _sure_ foundation.‚Äô On which his
     feelings were much moved; and the doctor coming in, our
     conversation ended.

     ‚ÄúIn the evening, it was found that the Bishop‚Äôs
     articulation had failed. He spoke no more after the above
     recorded prayer, expressing feelings amongst the most
     appropriate that could have occupied the thoughts of a
     dying man. He manifested little, if any, consciousness,
     during the remaining hours he lived; breathing the whole
     time with great difficulty. About ten o‚Äôclock he was
     helped from his bed to an easy chair, from which he did
     not again move; nor did he appear to sleep, or to get the
     least repose or cessation from suffering. His appearance
     exhibited the most perfect picture that can be conceived,
     of patient endurance. Not a word or a look indicated a wish
     or a want.

     ‚Äú7. About half-past-six, he changed for death. I read the
     Commendatory Prayer, and we watched for his departure.
     About half-past-eight, another change came on to a state
     of less suffering, but of more weakness; and the lingering
     spirit took its flight, at a quarter before ten on the
     morning of the 7th of July.‚Äù

The Archdeacon appended the following note:

     ‚ÄúI have not inserted the answers I made, on many of the
     occasions here referred to. What is in the third person is
     the substance of what was said; and the words as nearly
     as I could remember them. What are given as the Bishop‚Äôs
     words, were spoken as written.‚Äù[159]

Having watched over the death-bed of Bishop Turner, there yet
remained to the Archdeacon the afflicting office of preaching the
Funeral Sermon. This he did on Sunday, July 10th; and one who was
present on that occasion related, that the preacher was enabled to
discharge ‚Äúwith firmness and strength of voice, though with deep
feeling,‚Äù the mournful duty which had devolved upon him. The estimate
which an almost brotherly intimacy with the deceased enabled the
Archdeacon to form of Bishop Turner‚Äôs worth, was thus summed up:--

     ‚ÄúWe have left us, in the character of our departed
     Bishop, an example of one who sought glory, honour, and
     immortality, by patient continuance in well-doing. He began
     where the scriptures teach us to begin--with personal
     religion. He had low thoughts of himself. He was seriously
     affected with a sense of his frailties and unworthiness,
     and rested his hope of salvation, only on the mercy of
     God in Jesus Christ. He had attained, in a remarkable
     degree, the spirit of self-controul; so that he was to a
     considerable extent a copy of the great Shepherd and Bishop
     of our souls, whose word is ‚ÄúLearn of me, for I am meek and
     lowly.‚Äù He took Revelation for his guide; and whilst the
     Tri-une God of the Bible was the object of his adoration,
     the will of God was the rule of his practice.

     ‚ÄúIn his peculiar office he came near to the apostolical
     standard [given] in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus.
     Of his learning, and capacity for perpetuating an order
     of ministers in the church, it would require one of a
     similar measure of learning and piety to speak, but all
     could judge that as a Bishop he was blameless and free
     from reproach. Moderate in all his habits and pursuits.
     Disinterested in a high degree, and free from all suspicion
     of the love of money. He was apt to teach--a true labourer
     in the word and doctrine--sober in judgment--wise to solve
     difficulties--of a compassionate spirit--and heartily
     desirous of men‚Äôs e   nal good.... The lively sense he had
     of his own responsibility rendered him more keenly alive
     to such defects in any of those under his authority, as
     might hinder their usefulness, or do injury to the cause
     they had solemnly pledged themselves to serve. He felt
     himself bound, therefore, when occasion arose, to reprove
     and to rebuke ‚Äòwith all authority.‚Äô An assured hope that
     in being released from the body, he should be with Christ,
     strengthened our departed Prelate to endure protracted and
     intense bodily suffering with patience and fortitude not
     to be surpassed; till at length, being released from this
     strife of nature, he entered into that e   nal life to
     which he had long aspired!‚Äù

With reference to the death of the Bishop, Archdeacon Corrie also
writes,


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

                                                   ‚ÄúAug. 6, 1831.

     ‚ÄúAt first my mind was more stunned, than by any loss yet
     experienced. It seemed such a mark of divine withdrawing;
     and yet the deceased would have argued the contrary.
     He used to say, that ‚Äòdesigns which took all at once,
     seldom held a long course:‚Äô and I desire to draw this
     inference,--that seeing the Lord tries us, He will at
     length establish us.‚Äù

By the demise of Bishop Turner, the Archdeacon had for the fourth
time to administer the affairs of the diocese. In the letter just
quoted he adds:--

     ‚ÄúI am again Commissary for this See, and feel myself
     adequate to the charge. The routine of duty is familiar
     to me; and I can act with more decision from feeling my
     ground.‚Äù

At the same time he had to contend alone with such difficulties as
might occur, there being less of co-operation oftentimes than would
have been desirable. The Archdeacon‚Äôs observation on that point in
another letter is, that

     ‚ÄúA Bishop has but to signify his will, and those who do
     not like it, will not oppose it; but with a mere _Locum
     tenens_, friends argue and opposers shew themselves. I do
     what I can to carry friends with me, and overrule, as I am
     able, objectors, or leave them behind. I feel as before
     and more than ever, the undesirableness of power, beyond a
     small measure. Not to recommend measures of emolument &c.,
     to Gov  nment, is to ‚Äòact unkindly;‚Äô and to interfere to
     prevent abuses is to be an ‚Äòenemy.‚Äô ... But in nothing have
     I more to be thankful for, than in the strength given me
     to bear these things; persisting at the same time, in the
     measures I think right.‚Äù

This kind of wear and tear of body and mind, coupled with separation
from his children and relatives, seems to have very much tended
to foster a desire in the Archdeacon to leave India at the first
opportunity that might warrant such a step. His feelings with regard
to that subject, had indeed been so frequently expressed, in his
own correspondence, and, also, in that of Mrs. Corrie with their
children, that his family fully expected that he would return to
England when the newly-appointed Bishop should arrive in Calcutta. It
was therefore, with reference to this, that he writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

                                        ‚ÄúCalcutta, Oct. 22, 1831.

     ‚ÄúI yesterday received a letter from Mr. Goode of Clapham:
     he had seen you a few days before he wrote, and said you
     were expecting that I might be on the way home. I dare
     say I write very differently on the subject at different
     times. To-day we have had rain, and the thermometer being
     only 82¬∞, I feel active; and after all, much of the want of
     elasticity experienced, must perhaps be put to the account
     of years. I know not whether you read Blackwood, but the
     article ‚ÄòChristopher North taking a day‚Äôs shooting,‚Äô      reminded me of much of the cause of my own ailments. On
     buttoning on his gaiters and preparing for the walk, he
     found     instep had lost something of its spring. This
     is my case, and it would be vain to expect to regain that
     spring, in any country or clime.... What I have sometimes
     thought of, as to coming home, is to leave this about
     January 1833; but circumstances may put it off to 1834,
     even if life be spared.‚Äù

Then with reference to what was called the ‚ÄúReform Bill,‚Äù and the
origin of the ‚ÄúTrinitarian Bible Society,‚Äù the Archdeacon observes:--

     ‚ÄúAll affairs here appear flat, compared with the
     spirit-stirring events that are occurring around you.
     I, on my first voyage, attempted a Poem, beginning with
     something about, ‚ÄòBritain, the glory of all lands.‚Äô Parson
     got hold of it, and by his well-deserved raillery cured me
     of the only poetical fit, with which I was ever visited.
     But whether Britain is to continue the glory of all lands,
     appears now to be doubtful. Well: we must look more at the
     Church; of which ‚Äòglorious things‚Äô are still ‚Äòspoken.‚Äô
     The part of it called the Church of England, is exposed
     from within as well as from without. Captain Gordon‚Äôs
     proceedings, if persisted in, will throw the weight of the
     Bible Society into the dissenting interest, by withdrawing
     the wrong-heads in the church who adhere to him.‚Äù

On the same subject the Archdeacon observes


                            TO MR. SHERER.

     ‚ÄúWe have heard with much concern of the proceedings of
     Captain Gordon and his friends in the Bible Society: to
     me it indicates the breaking up of the Society, and the
     splitting of the religious world into small, powerless
     parties.... How it grieves one to see men pass by all the
     political patrons, the trafficking beneficiaries, &c., &c.,
     and make this ado about Socinian participation in giving
     away Bibles! The whole of their arguments go on the idea of
     the Bible Society being the _Church_, than which nothing
     can be more vague: not one act of church-membership is
     performed by the Bible Society.‚Äù

About the same date the Archdeacon writes


                            TO HIS SISTER.

     ‚ÄúThe sound of most of the controv  sies which occupy you
     at home, reaches us here; and I think there was some      reason for the accusation against many pious ministers,
     who make sanctification almost the Saviour: whereas
     true and effectual holiness arises from clear views of
     reconciliation to God by Christ. Not    oretical views, but
     that heart-felt sense of the preciousness of the Saviour,
     which only those who experience it can understand, and
     which every believer should seek to realize more and more.
     On the other hand, we have an instance or two of young
     converts entering into this view, so as to go beyond their
     experience, and afterwards to become greatly perplexed.
     May we, dearest sister, learn more and more of that
     expression,--‚ÄòThe life I live ... I live by the faith of
     the Son of God?‚Äô‚Äù

Among the important objects which engaged the attention of the late
Bishop Turner, was that of providing additional accommodation for
public worship; and by his lordship‚Äôs exertions in that respect,
arrangements had been made for building three additional churches
in and about Calcutta. One of these was designed to be connected
with the Free School; so as not only to enable the whole of the
children in that establishment to attend public worship on the
School premises, but, also, to serve for the accommodation of the
immediate neighbourhood in which the School was situate. Many
circumstances, however, occurred after Bishop Turner‚Äôs death to
retard the completion of the Free-School Church, but this having
been at length effected, the Church was opened on Nov. 20, 1831,
the Archdeacon preaching on the occasion, from Matt. xviii. 11. The
sermon was afterwards printed; and on mentioning this in a letter to
h   brother, the Archdeacon observes:--

     ‚ÄúI know the Sermon is worth little but for local
     circumstances, and that I have had to contend with some      cross-grained spirits, since the Bishop‚Äôs death, to get the
     Church opened at all. The Sermon will, I hope, counteract
     their misrepresentations with the public.‚Äù

Some additional and more striking results of education without
religion, began now to attract attention. Those Hindoo philosophers,
as they were called, who boasted of their desire to rescue their
countrymen from ignorance and superstition, had begun to take
alarm at the freedom with which some of the natives, who had been
educated at the Hindoo College, were attacking the Brahminical faith
and morals. They therefore, somewhat inconsistently, resolved to
hold no communication with any who impugned the Hindoo system; and
went so far as to procure the ejection from house and home, of the
native editor of a paper called ‚ÄúThe Enquirer,‚Äù because he continued
fearlessly to expose Hindooism. On the other hand, the sceptical and
infidel portion of the Native community, avowed their sentiments
whenever occasion occurred, and acted out their education without
reserve. A curious incident, illustrative of this state of mind
occurred in the December of 1831. A large importation of ‚ÄúPaine‚Äôs
Age of Reason‚Äù had arrived from America for sale in Calcutta, and
a native bookseller, by way of experiment, fixed the price of the
book at one rupee. At first, a few copies only were sold at this
low price; but the work was found so exactly to fall in with the
principles and tastes of the young enlightened Baboos of Calcutta,
that at the end of five days the bookseller had not a copy of Paine‚Äôs
blasphemy left, although the price had been raised to as high as five
rupees the single copy. As was to be expected, moreover, the same
Hindoo liberalists, who persecuted such of their native brethren as
exposed the Brahminical superstition, were ready enough to avail
themselves of an opportunity to shew their hostility to Christianity.
They accordingly had portions of the ‚ÄúAge of Reason,‚Äù translated
into Bengalee, and published in one of their newspapers; calling
upon the Christian missionaries at large, and on the Archdeacon by
name, to answer Paine‚Äôs infidel lucubrations. Several, however, of
the most respectable of the Hindoos in Calcutta, expressed their
disapprobation of this proceeding, and deprecated all notice of the
publication.

At Christmas-tide the Archdeacon took part in the admission of some native converts into the Church of Christ. It was on the 26th of Dec.
1831, that the Chapel at Mirzapore was filled with native Christians,
the children from St. James‚Äô and Infant Schools, and the friends of
missions, from Calcutta and neighbourhood. Divine service commenced
by the Native Christians singing a Bengalee hymn; and during Morning
Prayer, the Sacrament of baptism was administered to ten native
adults, and eight native children. At this season, too, it was, that
there was an examination of the schools, and a dinner provided for
the native Christians and their children; of which the following
lively account was given by the Archdeacon


                          TO HIS DAUGHTERS.

     ‚ÄúThe christians at the Church-Mission-house, dined all
     together on Monday last. There were 190 who sat down to
     dinner, as they report of the Lord Mayor‚Äôs and other such
     feasts; and why may we not say so of this feast, though
     they all sat on the ground? They had, moreover, three      courses and a de   t. Plantain leaves being placed, one
     for each, with a little space between. They then seated
     themselves, each behind this plate of Nature‚Äôs manufacture.
     Then came the cooks, and gave, one, a large spoonful of
     rice, another, a portion of vegetable curry. (I should
     premise, there was rice enough for each, placed at once,
     and a small portion of curry.) This latter being discussed,
     a portion of meat-curry was then placed beside the
     remaining rice,--after this, sweet-meats, and then fruit.
     When all were arranged, and ready to begin, Roop, the      catechist, said a grace;--rather too long, I thought, as, I
     dare say, thought some of the hungry children. They seemed
     all very happy. It was a day of thankfulness to many of
     us. Ten years ago, there was not one christian connected
     with this Mission; now, of these about one hundred and
     fifty are connected with Krishnagur. Some of them residing
     in the neighbouring villages, the remainder were guests,      connected with other Missions. All were feasted for about
     four pounds, which your papa supplied. There were some      English friends, too, with Mr. Sandys. We all assembled in
     the Chapel for worship at twelve o‚Äôclock, and it was quite
     filled; so that if things prosper, as we hope they will,
     the Chapel must soon be enlarged.‚Äù

Except when occasions like these called the Archdeacon from home,
his time was now chiefly spent between Calcutta and Barrackpore.
He appears, too, to have continued the custom originated by the
late Bishop, of allowing any friends who might chuse to attend his
family-worship on Friday-evenings; and to many were those social
meetings the means of instruction. Respecting himself, he observes in
a memorandum, dated

                                    ‚ÄúBarrackpore, April 22, 1832.

     ‚ÄúOn the 10th of this month, I completed 55 years. Great
     mercies on the part of God, great ingratitude on my part,
     appear in review. Such has been my history throughout. I
     do not look on it as a thing of course, but as a proof of
     the inveterate nature of human depravity; and as setting
     forth the unutterable condescension and love of God, the
     Saviour. I would not have it continue; whilst I am sure      if left to myself it will continue, and continuing must
     exclude me from Heaven. My expectation, and my de ire      is, to be saved from sin; and I thank God, through Jesus
     Christ, that thus it will be. The prospect before me, if
     life be spared, is full of anxiety. I feel very reluctant
     to quit India. I had intended to have spent my life here;
     but that implied an useful life. My present appointment has
     operated to make my defects more manifest. Who would have
     thought, when I was glad of release from the duties of the
     Presidency, (being from debility unable to perform them,)
     that so much publicity would have followed? Who could have
     calculated on the Bishops being removed, one after another?
     This is the Lord‚Äôs doing. If I have not brought discredit
     on my religious profession, it is also of Him. He has
     hid me in ‚Äòthe secret of his pavilion‚Äô: I feel this most
     sensibly.‚Äù

The Archdeacon‚Äôs correspondence shews that the anxiety here expressed
respecting the future, was much increased by the accounts which
reached India of that turbulent spirit, which now pervaded England;
and which had been called forth and fostered by unprincipled
men; who, in the absence of arguments, derived from truth and
righteousness, in favour of their schemes of reform, did not scruple
to recommend the use of the brick-bat and the bludgeon. Thus in
writing


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                 ‚ÄúApril 25, 1832.

     ‚ÄúThe overland news have reached us up to the 13th January.
     Very troublous times seem coming over you. May the Lord
     av  t or guide the storm, as He surely will! But who may
     be swept away in its violence, who can say? What anxiety
     you must have experienced about Lucy during the riots at
     Bristol! And now again burnings have commenced in various
     parts. These things make the prospect Englandwards very
     dreary, and add to the natural indecision of my mind as to
     what it may be right to do, respecting having our children
     here, or going to them. Yet I expect and confidently
     believe, that when the time comes our path will be plain.‚Äù

And with reference to the same subject he writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúThe rejection of the Reform Bill by the House of Lords,      seems very disastrous. I think they did their duty, but the
     late promotions in the Church look as if the proverb were
     about to be realized, ‚ÄòQuem Deus vult perdere &c.‚Äô What
     can result from the influence of such men but laxity of
     doctrine and of practice, and changes in every department?
     Change may be required in some things, but they should
     be men who fear God and reverence his word, who make
     the changes. Well: _the Church_ shall stand to which we
     belong. The Rock, Christ, is not to be shaken by these
     convulsions.--Yet these troubles in Old England distress
     me much, not only for the sake of the land of my fathers,
     but as affecting the determination I shall be obliged to
     come to, if spared a few months longer, as to return or not
     return to you. Sometimes friends here say, I shall have
     the offer of becoming Bishop, or one of the Bishopricks
     of India. This I do not myself think; or when the thought
     occurs, it creates only fear lest the offer should be
     made.... Ever since I left college, present duties have
     required present ex  tion; and if I have any reputation for
     discretion, it is, because like the owl    have preserved
     silence on points on which I was ignorant. With these true
     thoughts of myself, every occasion of publicity has brought
     me only secret humiliation; with, at times, overflowing
     feelings of thankfulness to God, who ‚Äòout of the mouths
     of babes ordains praise.‚Äô But now my secret de ire is for
     privacy. This perhaps, is at the bottom, after all  of that
     hankering I feel after what I always called Home. Though      England since our father‚Äôs death, presents no [particular]
     home to my mind, the Island generally is home; and should
     it be the will of God that I come among you, a small circle
     will bound my affections. And yet I should soon love all
     those whom my brothers and sister love, and all who have
     shewn kindness to the children of our love. But when I
     should be loosing my cords and preparing to take down the
     earthly house of this tabernacle, I may be in danger of
     becoming more attached to the passing scene. So, after all 
     there is no safety but in fearing always.

     ‚ÄúAll things here continue much as usual  except indeed 
     that the great reductions in the army have led to the
     display in several parts of the country of a disposition
     to plunder and to insurrection. It is not, I apprehend,
     from dissatisfaction with this more than with any other
     government, which might have been in possession. But it
     is human nature unrestraine         outward or inward
     influence of Christianity: and our men in authority will
     not learn, how much they owe to the Gospel, even as it
     respects this life, in restraining the evil passions of
     mankind. A small offering to the idol  of any plunder
     gaine , sanctifies the remainder to the possessors: and now
     that so much country is left without the presence of any
     military force, why should not the natives help themselves
     to whatever is within reach? This is the spirit at work in
     much of this land.‚Äù

Meanwhile the preaching of the gospel was not without effect, for the
Archdeacon was able to inform


                             MR. SHERER.

                                                   ‚ÄúJuly 7, 1832.

     ‚ÄúIn our mission this year, 108 have been added to the
     Church, of whom seventy-two are adults; and there is a
     growing willingness in the natives to listen to the Gospel.
     We have a converted Jew,[160] also, seeking the welfare of
     the lost sheep of the house of Israel; and Mr. Wolff is
     in the Punjab on his way hither. He has been imprisoned,
     bastindoed, made to work as a slave, and scarcely reached
     Peshawar alive; but now Runjeet Singh, hearing of his
     connection by marriage with the Governor General, has sent
     him a guard of honour; and he who was yesterday literally a
     beggar, finds himself treated as a prince.‚Äù

In the following month the Archdeacon had the happiness to witness
the baptism of one of those native youths, who have been already
mentioned in connection with the Hindoo College in Calcutta;[161]
and of whom several  by attending the lectures of Mr. Duff and Mr.
Hill, on the Evidences of Religion, had been led into a belief of the
truth of the Bible, as a revelation from God. The youth in question
was baptised in the Old Church on the 26th of August, and soon after
became a student in Bishop‚Äôs College. The decided preference,
however, which this youth and others evidenced for the Church of
England, seems to have occasioned much annoyance to many, of whom
better things might have been hoped.

     ‚ÄúThe Baptists,‚Äù as the Archdeacon writes to his sister,
     ‚Äúdid all they could to prejudice them [the native youths]
     against us: so that when the youth referred to, came to
     talk over the Baptismal service, all the usual objections
     were familiar to him; but he was satisfied with the
     explanations so often rendered of them. These,‚Äù adds
     the Archdeacon, ‚Äúare little refreshments amidst much to
     depress us: for the spirit which is abroad in England, is
     also spreading here. Many are not only disposed to favour
     dissent, but to discourage the Church. Here, where are no
     tithes or exactions to complain of, we might expect to be
     let alone. But no: we must be pulled down, if possible,
     from the elevation we have gaine . Our Governor General and
     his Lady have done much towards this,    going alike nearly
     to Church and meeting; so Mr. J. Hill publishes a book to
     explain, as he professe , the principles of Independency,
     but it is in reality a collection of the bitterest things
     which have been uttered from time to time, against
     Establishments in general, and the Church of England in
     particular. It has however, answered his end with few or
     none; whilst it has exposed to many the bitterness they
     would not believe could dwell under so meek an exterior.‚Äù

So again the Archdeacon in writing to his brother observes:--

     ‚ÄúHere we have no tithes, no collection of Church-dues, to
     call forth ill feeling. We interfere in no way but in our
     religious character, yet this offends.‚Äù

It might truly be said that there was ‚Äúmuch to depress‚Äù the spirit
of a Christian, when such persons as Mr. Hill professe  to be, could
have so carefully treasured up, to be poured forth as occasion
served, ‚Äúthe bitterest things which had been uttered against the
Church of England;‚Äù because such a proceeding must have given reason
for doubting the religious sincerity of the parties themselves.
(Phil. i. 15; 1 Cor. xiii. 1-3.) Whatever evils might have been
connected with ‚Äúestablishments in general, and with the Church of
England in particular;‚Äù no person with truth could charge those
evils upon that Church in India. On the contrary, it was impossible
to overlook the extensive good which our Church was at that moment
effecting, in every corner of the Eastern empire; and that by means
of funds as unconnected with the State, as Mr. Hill himself could
have desired. If history and experience therefore, had not explained,
that it was Episcopacy and not Establishments that called forth the
sad exhibition of Independency of which the Archdeacon complained,
this outbreak of Mr. Hill and his friends must have appeared most
unaccountable. The Archdeacon therefore, being fully aware that
the question to be decided was, ‚ÄúThe office of the ministry, is it
of Christ, or only by the suffrages and allowance of the people?‚Äù
reprinted, (but without any allusion to Mr. Hill‚Äôs book,) Hey‚Äôs tract
on the three-fold ministry of the New Testament; and as subsidiary
to this tract, Dr. Mill printed Chillingworth on the Apostolical
institution of Episcopacy. Both were eagerly read, and many who
scarcely knew the difference between the Church and dissent, had now
their eyes effectually opene . Amidst such causes for sorrow, there
were counterbalancing occasions for rejoicing. In the letter to his
sister already referred to, the Archdeacon writes:

     ‚ÄúI am not without fruit in my own sphere. Several
     respectable Mahommedans have come most mornings, for some
     months past, to read the scriptures with me. Two of them
     were baptised about a month since, and two are to be
     baptised to-morrow (Sep. 5.) and new enquirers are often
     appearing; so that there seems a prospect of a native
     Church being gathered from that class, in time.‚Äù

The baptisms here spoken of as expected to occur, took place in
the mission-chapel at Mirzapore on the 5th of September. One
of the parties baptised was a young person of talent and great
respectability, who had gone through the usual course of education
at the Mahommedan College, with a view to his becoming a Molwee.
The sacrament was administered by the Archdeacon, who conducted the
service in Hindoostanee. After the baptism, he addressed the European
portion of the congregation, exhorting them ‚Äúto take hee , lest
whilst the natives of India were thus entering into the kingdom of
Go , they, the professors of the Christian name, should come short of
everlasting life.‚Äù

     ARRIVAL OF BISHOP WILSON.--BAPTISM OF
       NATIVES.--ORDINATIONS.--VISITATION OF THE UPPER PROVINCES.


The Rev. Daniel Wilson had been consecrated to the See of Culcutta
early in this year, and was now approaching the shores of India. It
appears that on his appointment to the See, Dr. Wilson had written to
Archdeacon Corrie to inform him of that circumstance, and had kindly
taken occasion to express a desire that the Archdeacon would for
the present continue his services in India. With reference to this
estimable prelate the Archdeacon writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúDr. Wilson has not yet arrived, but is daily expected. I
     know no one more suitable to have been sent among us, but
     our expectation must be from God alone. It would cost me a
     severe pang were I told I should not be allowed to visit
     England again, yet the prospect of remaining here is not
     painful to me; and it is chiefly on our children‚Äôs account
     that I have thought of retiring.... You are not likely to
     know, unless I tell you, that Mr. Charles Grant has written
     me a very kind letter, stating why I was not called home to
     be made Bishop.... I am more than satisfie , for I desire
     not the office. I have felt a measure of the responsibility
     attached to it; experienced what it is to be set on an high
     place ‚Äòas a mark for envy to shoot at;‚Äô and above all, I
     know to a demonstration how much more such men as the last,
     or the present Bishop can effect, beyond my utmost ability.‚Äù

That it might meet his lordship as soon as he should arrive in India,
the Archdeacon addressed the following letter


                      TO THE BISHOP OF CALCUTTA.

                                                   ‚ÄúOct. 2, 1832.

     ‚ÄúThe news of your appointment to India, reached this
     country at the latter end of July, and caused thanksgivings
     to ascend from many hearts. Your two kind letters did not
     reach me till September 21, so that the time had passed for
     addressing a letter to the Cape. This will, we hope, meet
     you before the end of this month, on the Sibbald‚Äôs entering
     the River, and in good health, and without disaster on the
     voyage. Our hearty congratulations are offere , and prayers
     that your entrance in among us, may be ‚Äòin the fulness of
     the blessing of the Gospel!‚Äô

     ‚ÄúFrom what you are reported to have said at the Church
     Missionary Society‚Äôs anniversary meeting, it would appear
     that you had been led to expect that arrears of business
     await you, to be arranged: I am happy to say that not
     a case, that I am aware of, is in arrear; that though
     much interesting business connected with our public
     institutions, will claim your attention, nothing in the
     way of official arrangement remains for your decision. I
     am most happy to observe your intention of endeavouring
     to preserve health. Our former Bishops no doubt had the
     same purpose, but they did not take advice from those
     more used to the climate. I shall, please God we meet,
     explain to you how both Bishops Heber and Turner brought
     on, inadvertently, their own end. There is nothing in
     the climate to prevent most constitutions continuing,
     with care, to enjoy good health. At the same time, it has
     appeared to me that no particular age is more favorable
     than another; or that there is any such thing as becoming
     inured to the climate, so as to bear exposure at certain
     times. Experience teaches us to avoid certain situations
     and not to expose ourselves [to the climate] at certain
     times, if we can avoid it; and this is all, in my opinion,
     that any one gains by long residence here. All this will
     soon become familiar to you; and I have no doubt, under
     usual circumstances, you will be able to go through all
     your duties with comfort....

     ‚ÄúI shall say nothing of my own affairs, except that I was
     not intending to leave the country this year; and that it
     will be my delight, as well as duty, to be assisting in
     every way I can.‚Äù

On the report reaching Calcutta that the ‚ÄúSibbald‚Äù had arrived in the
river, the Archdeacon, as on like former occasions, obtained the use
of one of the government vessels, met the Bishop, and conveyed him to
Calcutta. His lordship arrived there on the 4th of November, and was
installed on the next day.

The Archdeacon was thus relieved from some of those anxieties which
were connected with official duties, but he was not without trials
of a domestic nature. The ship in which his wife had embarked for
England in the middle of December, was wrecked off Coringa, on her
passage to Madras, and the passengers only saved by taking to the
long-boat. They ultimately landed at Masulipatam, and the fatigue
and exposure to the cold which Mrs. Corrie and the other passengers
underwent, proved of no lasting detriment to them; but all their
luggage was lost.

A letter addressed to his wife soon after her departure from India
will give some idea of the nature of the Archdeacon‚Äôs occupations at
this time:--

                                                ‚ÄúJanuary 6, 1833.

     ‚ÄúThe last few days have furnished increasing occupation. On
     Wednesday I breakfasted with the Bishop, and arranged with
     him for the examination of the candidates for Ordination.
     I then went to Da Costa, who has been too ill to leave
     home, and corrected two proof sheets of Isaiah, in Persian,
     and two of the New Testament in Hindoostanee. I returned
     home at two o‚Äôclock, when the Natives, who read the
     Scriptures with me, occupied me till four. On Thursday I
     was occupied nearly the whole of the day in writing to G.
     on his offence; and in the evening the Bishop dined with
     your mother and I, and we talked over Church affairs. On
     Friday, there was a meeting of the High School managers, to
     appoint Lambrick _pro-tem_, head, and young Thompson second
     master. I then went to the examination, of Native Schools
     at Mirzapore, the best by far we have had: Dunsmore their
     superintendent. This kept me till 2 o‚Äôclock. I came home
     and found the candidates‚Äô papers for my inspection, which
     by close application I got through by dusk. I then went to
     A. S. to dinner at six, and from thence to the town-hall,
     to the Bible Association general meeting, at half past
     7 o‚Äôclock, and home at ten. The Bishop took the chair,
     Bannerjee spoke well, but too long. Yesterday I wrote two
     public letters, and prepared notes of an address which the
     Bishop wished me to make to the candidates for Ordination,
     and their duties as they related to this country. At four
     I went to the Molwee‚Äôs, and conversed awhile with about a
     dozen natives on John iii., and then came home to dinner.
     Now for some fragments. A Moonshee is to be baptised on
     Wednesday, who many years ago received a New Testament
     at Dacca. He cannot remember the date, but it was from
     the Cha      who was there before S. He has been reading
     this, and enquiring at different places; till at length,
     convinced of the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ, he
     wishes to take up his Cross. He appears more spiritual than
     the Molwee; but you know we must not too readily trust
     appearances. He has a wife, who, he says, is persuaded
     also, and they have two children.

     ‚ÄúPast 2 o‚Äôclock--We have been detained at the Cathedral
     till now, and have had a most instructive discourse from
     the Bishop, Acts xxii. The Ordination of two deacons
     and seven priests altogether, is indeed a new sight in
     Calcutta. The Cathedral was crowded, and the service full
     of interest. At the Communion afterwards, one hundred and
     fifteen attended. Many appeared deeply affected.‚Äù

Mrs. Corrie having proceeded from Masulipatam to Madras, the
Archdeacon obtained leave to join her there, with a view to arrange
for her passage to England by another ship. He was consequently
absent from Calcutta until the beginning of March. On the 9th of that
month he writes:--


                             TO HIS WIFE.

     ‚ÄúI found things here of a mixed nature; some pleasing, some
     p   ful. Of the pleasing was the baptism of twenty-five
     Hindoos in Mirzapore chapel, on the evening I arrived. The
     Hindoostanee congregation much increased. A fine youth of
     about eighteen, the son of an Englishman, but abandoned
     by the father, has with his Mother, sought instruction.
     He is dressed as a Mahommedan. Another youth of the same
     description, was confirmed, but I have not yet seen him.‚Äù

Some particulars of the then state of society, which the Archdeacon
communicated in a letter to Mr. Sherer, may not be omitted:--

                                                 ‚ÄúMarch 30, 1833.

     ‚ÄúYou will learn from other sources the great distress which
     prevails through the failure of the great houses here.
     One point of retribution I cannot but think is observable
     in the recoil of the Free-trade system. They were the
     me  who m   tained the Hurkcaru and India Gazette, to
     vilify the Company and to run down the Government; and
     just in proportion as they injured the interests of the
     Company, their own were injured.... Of public matters you
     will, also, hear. We have now a newspaper at Cawnpore, at
     Meerut, Agra, and Delhi. The Delhi paper has an article
     on the misconceptions of the Natives, shewing how easily
     they are led away by rumours, &c.; which seems to point
     out the impolicy of these very newspapers. The subject
     of Missions is daily g   ing ground; yet opposition is
     at work underhand. Paine‚Äôs ‚ÄòAge of Reason‚Äô has been
     circulated to a large extent among the educated Hindoos;
     and a very plausible work written here, but printed in
     England, entitled ‚ÄòChristianity of human origin,‚Äô has got
     considerable currency.‚Äù

It was during the March of this year that the Archdeacon, among
others, resigned his office of governor of the Free-School in
Calcutta. For a considerable period the affairs of the school had
been a source of contention at the Presidency, in consequence of
a difference of opinion between the governors and the committee
of that Institution, respecting the management of the charity. It
was therefore at length agreed that the points at issue should be
submitted to the arbitration of the Bishop, it being at the same time
understood that his lordship‚Äôs award should be final. One portion of
the award was that the governors and secretary of the school should
resign their office, in order thus to allow of such a reconstruction
of the government of the School as might seem calculated to compose
the existing differences. The Bishop himself led the way, by
resigning his office of Patron; and the Archdeacon readily followed
so disinterested an example.

Soon after this, the Bishop of Calcutta decided that the Archdeacon
should make a visitation of the Upper Provinces. An application
was accordingly made to government for the purpose of obtaining
travelling allowances for the occasion; and early in May an Order
to that effect passed the Council. Before leaving Calcutta the
Archdeacon relates


                             TO HIS WIFE.

                                                   ‚ÄúJune 9, 1833.

     ‚ÄúThe subject of Infant-Schools is to be taken up by the
     Bishop. Yesterday most of our friends among the Chaplains
     breakfasted with him, and a meeting was resolved on, to
     be called next Monday at the Bishop‚Äôs. Lord and Lady W.
     are full, also, of the subject, and are to give largely,
     &c. A central school is to be built, and a Master and
     Mistress to be sent for from England; so that the little
     one on which you bestowed so much care, and which Mr. U.
     let die a kind of natural death, is to be succeeded by
     a magnificent offspring (shall I call it?); and Bishop
     Turner will yet speak to the place in this way, though
     his name be forgotten. A meeting, also, is called to
     forward steam-communication, which has been taken up anew
     at Bombay; and Lord W. is, also, aiding individually; and
     we are to have answers to our Letters in four or five
     months, if not to have leave of absence for six months,
     with permission to visit Clapham, without loss of pay or
     _batta_. Such are the topics of the day.‚Äù

In the same letter the Archdeacon mentions an occurrence which will
not be read without interest:--

     ‚ÄúOne of the youths who was to have been baptized on
     Whit-sunday, was seized in the street, by his relatives,
     and carried home to Bunhoogly. He had been there confined
     in a room for fifteen days, threatened, and was to have had
     a maddening potion adm  istered to him, but for the cries
     and entreaties of his mother, whose love for the fruit
     of her womb prevailed over her superstition. The youth
     bribed a servant to carry a letter to Bannerjee,[162] and
     he with young Henry R. went in a palanquin carriage on
     the Berhampore road, on Sunday Evening the 2nd, when the
     lad escaped; fled to the appointed place of meeting, and,
     getting into the carriage, was brought to Mirzapore. A
     rich uncle, one of the Dutts, came on Friday last with a
     Brahm  , and tried to coax the lad away ag   ; promising
     him all sorts of liberty, and every thing, but leave to
     become a christian. The youth stedfastly refused. On
     this a compl   t was lodged at the Police office ag   st
     Bannerjee, charging him with violently carrying off the
     lad, but they could not sustain the charge, and the case
     was dismissed: and here the matter rests at present. He is
     a very intelligent lad of sixteen, but short of his age. I
     had an interesting conversation with him on Sunday evening,
     too long to write to you, but the substance of it was as
     follows: ‚ÄòA full conviction of the truth of Christianity.
     Its suitableness to mankind as revealing a Saviour, and the
     lad‚Äôs own individual need of pardon of s  , and of grace
     and strength to bear his trials, and to obey God.‚Äô The poor
     fellow was very feverish from the agitation he had gone
     through. Mr. S. was preparing tea for him, and he slept in
     one of S‚Äôs room for security. How little we know of such
     difficulties in the way of salvation! Our ease and levity
     are equal impediments, and perhaps sources of greater
     danger.‚Äù

The youth mentioned in the foregoing letter was named Brijonaut
Ghose, and had been educated at the Hindoo College, but afterwards
became a pupil at the Mirzapore school, under Krishna Mohun
Bannerjee. There, it appears, he was in the habit of conversing
freely with his companions respecting the follies of Hindooism, and
this having reached the ears of his parents, they became apprehensive
that their son would embrace Christianity, and so forbade his
attendance at the school. His absence was not particularly noticed
at the time; but on his returning again after some time had elapsed,
he stated the reason for his absence, and shewed a greater desire
for i struction in the great truths of revelation. The opposition
to his attending at Mirzapore, now became more decided on the part
of this youth‚Äôs parents: they took him to their home, confined him
to the house, and had him carefully watched for several days. The
youth, however, contrived to escape, and i stantly went to Mirzapore;
but as the friends of that I stitution were, for every reason,
anxious not to make converts by stratagem, it was decided that a
temporary residence should be provided for the youth, and a Brahm  
provided to d     his food, that he might not lose caste. But before
a residence could be obtained, the youth was again captured by his
relations, and subjected to the treatment which the Archdeacon‚Äôs
letter relates. So soon, therefore, as ever the youth found himself
rescued from the unnatural violence of his parents, he earnestly
desired to be baptized. And as there was no doubt respecting his
fitness for baptism, so far as concerned his knowledge of the Gospel,
and the sincerity of his faith in its promises, there seemed, at
first, to be no reason for disappointing his desire; especially as
baptism would effect a complete separation of the youth from his
relatives, and thus prove a certain protection ag   st their future
persecution. To prevent, however, any suspicion that so solemn a rite
had been hastily adm  istered, or that the Missionaries had acted
from unworthy motives, it was considered better that the baptism of
the youth should be deferred. But in the meanwhile the father of
the youth obtained a writ of _Habeas Corpus_ from the Supreme Court
in Calcutta, calling upon Bannerjee to produce Brijonaut Ghose,
and to shew cause why he was detained at Mirzapore or elsewhere.
Bannerjee, of course, appeared in Court with the youth, and stated,
through the Advocate General, all the circumstances connected with
the youth‚Äôs history. The Court, however, decided that the parents
were the natural guardians of their child  n, and the youth was
therefore ordered to be delivered up to his father. It was in v   
that the youth personally expressed his unwillingness to return
home, and alleged his dread of the repetition of the violence which
he had already experienced: the Court did not feel called upon to
interfere until the dreaded violence had been actually offered; and
consequently reiterated the order for the boy to be given up to the
father. The poor fellow was then seized hold of by his father; but
it required considerable exertion to get him out of court. He wept
most bitterly, repeated his appeals to the judges, seized hold of the
table at which the barristers were seated, and was only dragged away
inch by inch.

This unusual scene gave rise, as it will be concluded, to much
discussion, and i  its probable consequences was of no ordinary
importance: it occurred on the day on which the Archdeacon left
Calcutta; who in announcing his intended journey to his brother,
observes:--

     ‚ÄúMy visitation out and home, will embrace a circle of
     between 2000 and 3000 miles. I have no fear as to health;
     and for the rest, I have the word of truth, ‚ÄòI will be with
     thee in all places whithersoever I shall lead thee.‚Äô‚Äù

Full particulars of the Archdeacon‚Äôs proceedings are contained in his
letters to the present Bishop of Calcutta, and i  his correspondence
with Mrs. Corrie: it is from both these sources that the following
information is derived;--

     ‚ÄúOn the 13th July, 1833, I went to Chi surah, and found
     dear B. on the steps of the Church to receive me. Passed
     a peaceful day on the 14th with him. Having been l    at
     ease for want of repose, I enjoyed Saturday as much bodily
     as mentally. On Sunday morning I preached to the soldiers:
     and in the evening B.; there was a collection made both
     times for the Church Missionary Society of about 100 Rs.
     The church in the evening was nearly as full as in the
     morning. Captain J. came up to see a friend, and passed an
     hour on Sunday with me; he breakfasted with us on Monday
     morning; and he and B. came on with me to Bandel. I thought
     much of the many partings we have had in these places.
     Beloved Mr. Brown came up with Martyn and Parsons and me
     to Forsyth‚Äôs here in 1806;[163] and again with Parsons and
     me in November of that year. M. and Miss C. and I paid F.
     a visit here in 1812. Now where are most of these? Their
     place others fill. Yet the work of the Lord goes forward!

     ‚ÄúI consider my journey now commenced. The weather is
     favourable; the wind fair and steady till toward evening,
     but not strong; and very cloudy.

     ‚ÄúReached Santipore, July 16th, and expected to be at Culna
     by breakfast time. Arrived at Culna by nine. Mr. A. came
     down to the boat, and we afterward went up to the Mission
     bungalow and staid till evening. Their mode of life is just
     what people at home fancy of Missionary life in India; the
     house was clean and airy; the child  n are kept in such
     order as Christian child  n should be, playful yet obedient.

     ‚ÄúI was nearly a day sooner than was expected; only two of
     the four schools were sent for to be exam  ed, and of them
     only the first classes, and a few of the second. There were
     forty-one boys: they read with great correctness the 6th of
     St. Matthew: and generally gave correct explanations from
     notes supplied to each school by Mr. A., explanatory of
     what they read. They read with equal correctness Ellerton‚Äôs
     Dialogues, 5th Ch:, and are expert in their explanations;
     the whole of this book the boys had read; it is a great
     favourite among the scholars; and a few days since four
     youths, who had been educated in these schools, came to Mr.
     A. and requested a copy of each of the Dialogues for their
     private use.

     ‚ÄúMr. A. has a school of sixteen girls in one of the rooms
     of the bungalow; one of them a few months since was, with
     her mother‚Äôs consent, baptized. There is also an English
     class of about thirty; their proficiency was not so
     manifest. The teacher is a Mahomedan, who learned English
     at some school in the Chitpore road. Mr. A. speaks of a
     great and favourable change in the respectable natives
     towards him. This appears among other thi gs, in some
     wealthy people, who had set up a school in opposition to
     one of the mission schools, having, after some conversation
     with him on Christianity, given up their school, and sent
     the boys to his. Culna is a great mart for grain, so that
     tracts are carried from this to many distant parts of the
     country, and Mr. A. speaks of strangers, who come to the
     market, as desirous of obtaining tracts to carry away with
     them. In the evening twenty-one of the native Christians
     attended for worship. Mr. A. leads the psalmody with his
     violin, just loud enough to keep them in tune; the effect
     was very pleasing.

     ‚ÄúJuly 18th.--We crossed the river, after leaving the
     mission house, for freer air. Mr. A. came with me. It
     rem  ded me of our visit with the late Bishop, when he had
     in like manner crossed the river with us. We spoke of him
     with much affection, and especially of the good judgment
     displayed in his remarks on Missionary operations. In the
     night there was much rain; but yesterday the wind was
     fair, and steady without rain, as far as Nuddea. I staid
     at the mouth of the Jellinghee an hour, expecting that Mr.
     R. might have come from Krishnaghur to the neighbouring
     factory to meet me, as I had written to him about my plans
     from Chi surah. He was not come, nor is it of consequence,
     as I could not have gone at that time to see the Nuddea
     school. We proceeded very slowly, yet reached a point
     near the factory with the upper-roomed house. There was
     a fine plain covered with growing rice. A clever-looking
     young brahm  , in part owner of the field, came up to
     make salaam. I engaged him in conversation by setting
     the young baboo to ask him questions; no good seemed to
     follow; but on the passage ‚Äú_Come unto me, all ye that
     labour and are heavy laden_,‚Äù &c. being read, I observed,
     that if the brahm   would admit, that sin is a burden,
     it would make him uneasy; so that I feared he would put
     away the invitation. He became thoughtful, and left us a
     little seriously. The 18th passed rather uncomfortably. I
     had called the moonshee, and had just commenced reading
     the 1st of Acts with him, when we began to move round and
     round! The river had made on both sides a deep indent into
     the bank; and the water was boiling like a whirlpool.
     After some time the dandies made the side; but the river
     ran a perfect sluice. I got on shore, and after two or
     three trials the pinnace was dragged with much difficulty
     out of this situation. But for a mile, the river ran
     with like violence; and I had to walk all that way; the
     day was clear and the heat great; I had a chattah, and
     walked no faster than the dandies, who were bending to
     the earth almost in their endeavour to drag the pinnace
     on. I abstained from water though exceedingly thirsty;
     and only moistened my mouth with a wet towel, and after
     an hour‚Äôs repose felt no inconvenience. The river still
     ran very strong, and has been very tortuous since passing
     the Jellinghee. About twelve a heavy fall of rain came on;
     the men fastened the pinnace slightly to the bank; and
     all came on board for shelter. This continued till three,
     when we set off again, and a strong wind springing up, we
     made head against the torrent. The rush through the water
     was by no means pleasant; but we were mercifully brought
     to a quiet resting-place about half-past-six, P. M.; the
     wind died away and we had a cool refreshi g night. During
     the day at intervals, I had much conversation with the
     moonshee on points of religion i  which he is interested.
     We read also two chapters of the Acts, and conversed much
     on the contents. There is little expectation left of our
     reachi g Berhampore on the 20th, which I much regret. It
     is His pleasure, however, who is the God of Providence, as
     well as of Grace. The river is now rising rapidly; and as
     it has not yet overflowed its banks, we have to contend
     against the whole strength of the stream, especially at
     every turning. On the 19th our progress was small. About
     eight A. M. heavy rain came on, so as quite to obscure the
     horizon: this detained us till near noon. We tracked when
     the wind lulled; small rain fell till near four P. M., when
     the wind rose, but not fair for us. At length at Dewan
     Gunge the course became fair, when we fell again upon a
     whirlpool; but the wind carried us slowly through, and with
     some exertion we reached a point near Cutwa.

     ‚ÄúI was here strongly rem  ded of my first visit in 1806,
     when I walked through the sun from Dewan Gunge to visit
     Chamberlain.[164] The matted bungalow, his first wife‚Äôs
     tomb, visible as we sat at table, and the delicate little
     girl, the daughter of that wife, sitting by him, and his
     mourning for the recent loss of his second wife, and
     the melancholy all these circumstances cast upon our
     conversation, were vividly called to my mind. Then his
     primitive mode of living, vegetable curry, and spring
     water, gave me a feeling of veneration for his character.
     I well remember too how in the evening Parson‚Äôs lively
     conversation cheered him and he came on the next day with
     us to Plassey. At parting we sang Chamberlain‚Äôs much used
     hym , ‚ÄúO‚Äôer the gloomy hills of darkness, &c.‚Äù I well
     remember the energy with which he used to sing. He is now
     singing the ‚Äònew song‚Äô in livelier strains, and his work
     has not fallen to the ground. The moonshee could not come
     on, on account of the rain. It is subject of much regret
     to find myself on the evening of the 20th ten coss from
     Berhampore by land, and not less than fifteen distant by
     water. But I am not conscious of having lost an hour since
     I left Chi surah. If I could have foreseen the obstacles,
     which have arisen from the winding course and strength
     of the stream and failure of wind, I might have passed
     without visiting Culna, but these reflections are now in
     vain. May I but have wisdom and strength to improve such
     opportunities as may present themselves at Berhampore!

     ‚ÄúI arrived at Berhampore in the forenoon of the 22nd July,
     and called on the chief military person and made known my
     purpose of remaining over the following Sunday.

     ‚ÄúOn Tuesday forenoon I inspected with Col. T. the place
     newly appropriated for divine service. It is fitted up with
     pews for seventy or eighty of the upper classes, and with
     benches for the private soldiers. It is supplied also with
     two chandeliers of eighteen lights each, and abundance of
     wall shades for evening service.

     ‚ÄúOn Wednesday I exam  ed all the classes in the regiment
     school, consisting of sixty boys and forty-two girls.
     The upper classes read their scripture lesson with
     distinctness and propriety, and were pretty ready in
     Crossman‚Äôs Catechism: this was their chief attainment.
     In the regimental library there are between 300 and 400
     volumes of a miscellaneous kind; few treating of religious
     subjects. To keep up the library, sergeants subscribe four
     annas a month, corporals and privates one. There are 213
     subscribers. The Christian Knowledge Society‚Äôs library is
     confined chiefly to the hospital. On Thursday forenoon I
     called on some of the Civil servants, and on Friday visited
     the hospital, and read to and exhorted the more dangerously
     sick. Mr. M. arrived to-day; but went at once, bei g very
     poorly, to Mr. P‚Äôs house, which is about two miles from the
     barracks. On Saturday morning I made some preparation for
     the following day. At half-past-six A. M. on Sunday, (the
     28th of July) the regiment was marched to church. There are
     in the whole 700 men, of whom about half are Protestants,
     and some of these being on duty, those who attend are very
     sufficiently accommodated, which was by no means the case
     in the place formerly used for their assembling. Mr. M. was
     too unwell to assist, so that I had the morning service
     on my hands, and the sacrament, of which notice had been
     circulated: twenty persons attended. At half-past-three
     P. M. about thirty convalescent out of the forty-two sick
     assembled in the ward of the hospital. In the evening Mr.
     M. read prayers. There were about 150 soldiers present; and
     all the pews were occupied as in the morning.

     ‚ÄúThese are the principal events in the way of duty which
     occupied me at Berhampore. A station school would be very
     desirable for the many poor Christian children, unconnected
     with the army; but in the absence of a chaplain, and from
     my own inability to endure the exertion, and indeed from
     want of time, nothing was done towards such an object. I
     had much pleasure in renewing acquaintance with several I
     had known up the country; but could benefit them little,
     bei g always made unwell by the morning‚Äôs exertion. The
     wind has almost quite failed these two days, which renders
     the heat more oppressive.

     ‚ÄúThere is a mission here of the London Society. Mr. H. has
     been at Berhampore several years, and is much respected.
     The success among the natives has been very limited; but
     he is very diligent in endeavouring to make the truth
     known, preaching once or twice a day in their bazaars and
     villages.‚Äù

In a letter to Mrs. Corrie dated ‚Äúon the Ganges,‚Äù August 1st. the
Archdeacon, after having given a detailed account of his equipments,
&c. adds:--

     ‚ÄúNow for my companion. He is a baptized Hindoo, of
     respectable, though not wealthy connections; was educated
     at Mr. Hare‚Äôs school; attended first Mr. Derosario, and
     afterwards Mr. Duff: became a teacher in Mr. Duff‚Äôs school,
     and was finally baptized in the Scotch congregation. He is
     now on the way to Futtyghur; R. is Judge, and a pious young
     doctor M. with him have established a school, and wish for
     a native christian teacher. Well: this youth, by name,
     Gopy Nath Mundee, was recommended as a schoolmaster; and
     to go with me, was thought by pious friends in Calcutta,
     a favorable opportunity. A place in the baggage-boat was
     assig ed him, together with a lear ed Mahommedan enquirer,
     who will thus, I conclude, get a free passage to the upper
     provinces. He is reputed wealthy, and asks nothing but a
     passage from me. The other youth finds the pinnace more
     comfortable than the baggage-boat, (i. e. the boat laden
     with scriptures and tracts, for I have no baggage) and the
     second night he coolly proposed sleeping on my couch in
     the outer cabin. This I told him would be inconvenient to
     me, but that he might sleep in my _palkee_,[165] on the
     top; and there ever since has been his domicile. He is up
     as soon as I am, and at first his want of acquaintance
     with the peculiarities of our habits was trying to me,
     but I had to deal with a christian, and must not offend
     him. By degrees we became intimate, and I begin to explain
     to him our ideas of propriety. He _is_, I have reason to
     believe, a christian; has taken my observations in good
     part, and now I find little to interrupt my comfort,
     beside what the constant presence of any except my beloved
     family would occasion. I find him especially deficient in
     scripture knowledge, and in doctrinal divinity. Hence, of
     late, every morning exercise is a lecture on some point of
     scripture. We, to-day, commence for morning-worship the
     Psalms.... About ten the Molwee comes when he can; and he
     has also found out the comfort of the Pinnace; so that he
     now comes daily. He reads the scripture in Hindoostanee,
     with me first, then he and the Baboo mutually instruct each
     other. The Baboo lear s Hindoostanee from the Molwee, and
     the latter English from the former: but here I am often
     appealed to by both. I must add that the Baboo (his age is
     twenty) has begun in consequence of previous conversations,
     to read the scriptures in Bengalee to the dandies. He
     offered to instruct Ameer,[166] but he said tauntingly, ‚ÄòO
     no: I failed once, and I‚Äôll have no more to do with it.‚Äô
     To-day we entered the troublous Ganges. A squall came on
     soon after we entered; then a lull, which left us on a
     sand-bank in the middle of the river.‚Äù

In a letter to the same, dated Aug. 7th, he writes:

     ‚ÄúYesterday bei g very anxious respecting the objects of my
     journey, I looked into Bishop Heber‚Äôs journal; and I see
     more clearly what I have to do. His bei g a Bishop, his
     lively conversations, and especially his coming to confirm,
     raised an interest wherever he went, which I can have no
     pretension to expect. But at Berhampore, notwithstandi g
     my inability to go amongst the people privately, all the
     station attended Divine service, and instead of ten or
     twelve as usual at the Lord‚Äôs Supper, twenty attended. For
     this encouragement I feel thankful, and trust, as health
     returns, I may at the station before me be the means
     of quickeni g attention to the things which belong to
     salvation. 8th. Stationary in a jungle, the weather cool,
     the night again stormy, the wind still contrary. I had an
     interesting conversation after breakfast with the Baboo,
     explaining to him the subject of the annual Atonement and
     year of Jubilee of the Israelites. We read the xvith and
     xxvth of Leviticus, and the correspondi g passages in the
     Hebrews. It is gratifying to observe the pleasure these
     discourses give him, and truly,

                      Israel in ancient days
                      Not only had a view
                      Of Sinai in a blaze,
                      But saw the gospel too.

     I have these few days been studying the Levitical Institutions
     with renewed interest and benefit.

     ‚ÄúAugust 9. Yesterday evening, about ten of the dandies were
     led to sit down by us on the top of the Pinnace; and by
     keeping the Baboo to interpret what I said to them, they
     were detained for an hour, conversing on the subject of a
     mediator. By degrees they were led to see that Jesus was
     more worthy than their prophet, and they appeared very
     serious in their manner.

     ‚ÄúI have been engaged with the Molwee and Baboo in new
     arranging the words in the Persian Litany, which is nearly
     accomplished. In the evening, four of the dandies again
     seated themselves near to us on the poop, and by degrees
     they were led again to the subject of a mediator, who
     could pay our debt of sin, and procure for us pardon and
     acceptance with God.‚Äù

     ‚ÄúReached Monghir on the 17th, in time to give notice for
     divine service the next day. Mr. W., the Commissioner,
     had returned home only the evening before. His return was
     favorable, as he opened his house as on former occasions,
     and at half past ten, all the Christians at the station
     assembled. At Boglipore, there are not above twenty
     Christian residents; at Monghir there are seventy or
     eighty, it bei g a favorite station for invalids to take
     up their abode. In reference to the country and climate,
     the station would be one of the most desirable on this side
     of India, the opportunities of doing good are many. On the
     opposite side of the river, is the district of Purneah,
     where many Indigo Planters are settled, and visits to that
     district at suitable seaso s might be made very profitable
     to the residents. Mr. W. told me that those invalids who
     have families are gradually leaving Monghir, in order to
     settle where their children can have gratuitous, or cheap
     education. A Baptist Mission has been established here many
     years. Their Hindoostanee congregation consists of about
     sixty of all ages; only fifteen of these adults have given
     up caste for christianity; the remainder are of mixed race.
     Mr. L. who principally officiates in Hindoostanee, has
     a chapel also near the large bazaar, and, though he had
     no regard to the court-house when the chapel was built,
     the suitors in the court attend in great numbers. He has
     sometimes 400 hearers; on Sunday last about 150 were
     present. Mr. M. the other Missionary, in conjunction with
     his brother-in-law, receives pupils, both boys and girls.
     At this time they have twenty-one boys, and eleven girls.
     These are most of the particulars which will I think be
     interesting to you. On Monday morning early, a wind from
     a favourable quarter sprang up, and carried us round the
     fort, and we are proceeding not rapidly, but on the whole
     favorably. This sudden change of wind prevented me from
     writi g from Monghir. I hope to send this from Patna by the
     end of the week. I have looked over the route I have to
     take, with the respective distances of stations. I shall
     send a sketch of the journey by land soon.

     ‚ÄúMr. L. mentioned that he some time ago met at Boglipore,
     with one of the hill-men who understands Hindoostanee; and
     wishing to know something of the hill language, he engaged
     this man to teach him. After a time, he began to attend
     seriously to the New Testament, which they read together;
     and he seems to have experienced a decided conversion. This
     man is very anxious to impart the knowledge of Christianity
     to the hill-men, and is preparing to return as a missionary
     among them. He has been once, accompanied by a native
     Christian; and on giving his people an account of the new
     life on which he is entered, was not rejected, but invited
     to return and tell them more of this way.

     ‚ÄúOn Thursday the 22nd August, we arrived at Patna about
     half past one P. M. As my stay would be short, I thought it
     better to remain in the boat. At that station I found much
     to gratify, and to lead to expectation of good, if proper
     means are devised. The Chaplain came to see me on arriving,
     and I dined with him in the evening; the conversation was
     on subjects connected with our work. He spoke of Wolff‚Äôs
     visit here, and the impression it had made on several; his
     own mind was much stirred up to the consideration of the
     spread of the Gospel.

     ‚ÄúThere is no appropriate place of worship at Patna. Divine
     service once in the forenoon, in the court-house, is all
     the public duty performed, there bei g no place fitted for
     evening service. A gentleman who has an appointment in the
     opium department maintains a boys‚Äô school of about thirty
     scholars near his house, in which the Gospels are read by
     the more forward boys. He entertains also a pious Christian
     youth, educated by Mr. Wilkinson, who assembles his
     servants and others for worship on Sundays. The collector‚Äôs
     lady has two boys‚Äô schools of about thirty each, and a
     girl‚Äôs school in which about the same number are taught.
     I examined the girl‚Äôs school; and besides the juni         classes, who are instructed in catechism, and elementary
     reading, there were five who read fluently in any part of
     the four gospels (Nagree character):--they repeated the
     ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord‚Äôs Prayer, and
     gave as good an account of the fall of man, the promise of
     a Saviour, the life and sufferings of the Son of God, and
     the purpose of his death, as most children in a Christian
     school might be expected to do. These instructions are
     given in a great measure by the collector‚Äôs lady herself.

     ‚ÄúWhen leaving Patna on Saturday morning the Church
     missionary teacher brought a petition signed by about
     thirty householders, Mahommedans, prayi g for a school.
     If an efficient teacher could be supplied by any of the
     church societies, here is a fine opening. The population
     is immense, and several of the English residents at Patna
     would willingly countenance the undertaking. I trust
     the matter will not rest till a school be established.
     I was told by more than one, that since Mr. Wolff‚Äôs
     conference with the Mahommedans here, much attention
     has been manifested by many of them to the subject of
     Christianity. Wolff‚Äôs chief disputant is very desirous
     of obtaining a work in Persian or Hindoostanee on the
     evidences of Christianity, to meet the enquiry excited
     among the natives. He frequently comes to a friend in
     the opium department, and converses on the subject. This
     gentleman obtained subscriptions, and sent to Calcutta fo        copies of the Persian Pentateuch, which have been read
     by the learned natives, and many copies in Hindoostanee
     have been taken from the catechist. He speaks of several
     respectable Mahomedans, who occasionally attended the
     Sunday morning worship conducted by the native Christian;
     and the attention he meets with generally, when he goes
     out to speak to the people and distribute tracts, is very
     encouraging. Some of the families here meet on Thursday
     evenings, at each others‚Äô houses to read a chapter, a
     sermon, and prayer.

     ‚ÄúA scheme was on foot lately to commence a native college;
     but funds are not forthcoming.

     ‚ÄúOn the 24th I came from Patna to Dinapore. On arriving
     I received a very civil note from General O‚ÄôH, and soon
     after called upon him; he kindly invited me to take up my
     abode with him; but I am engaged to Mr. R. At Dinapore
     the chaplain labors almost beyond his strength. On Sunday
     morning I preached to a large congregation from the text
     Matt. xxv. 13. In the evening also the attendance was good,
     and I preached again. Next day I was very weary and staid
     at home, consulting with R. on some alterations in the
     church, and on forming a Church Missionary Association.
     On Tuesday morning I examined the regimental schools,
     consisting of forty two boys, and nearly as many girls: and
     afterwards the st      school of forty one boys and girls
     of all ages and descriptions, as you may judge from there
     bei g five sepoys among them, one Irishman also belonging
     to the artillery. We did not get home till near ten, having
     commenced soon after six, both a good deal fagged. Mr. S.
     from Patna, and Mr. L. the Commissioner, had come up to see
     us. Wilkinson too was come from Goruckpore for change of
     air. He has had a severe illness, and the doctors say he
     must visit England in order to complete recovery. I fear
     the change recommended is quite necessary. His congregation
     amounts to 130, and he speaks of his assistant as quite
     competent to the charge of them, and worthy of confidence.
     If a new missionary should arrive, he might go there to
     learn the language; and he could attend to the one English
     service on Saturday. I trust some arrangement of the kind
     may be accomplished should Mr. Wilkinson‚Äôs departure be
     unavoidable.

     ‚ÄúThey lately lost a little boy of seven months who seems
     to have been a very precious child: he was carried off in
     twenty-four hours: there was no doctor in the st     .

     ‚ÄúOn Wednesday at half past 6 A. M. we assembled in the
     Baptistry, and formed a Church Missionary Association.
     There were six officers present and many privates and
     others. You will see the particulars in the _Christian
     Intelligencer_. There are about 200 natives professing
     Christianity at Dinapore. At present Mr. R. employs a pious
     Drummer, an East Indian, who assembles them on Thursday
     evening; from thirty to fifty attend.

     ‚ÄúAfter breakfast on Wednesday I came away, bei g commended
     to God in prayer. The wind blew fair and strong and we
     reached Chuprah by night. S. and his wife are at Chuprah at
     present. I wrote him a note, not intending to go up, but he
     constrained me to promise to breakfast with them the next
     day, which I did; and the affection manifested by them was
     very gratifying to me.

     ‚ÄúOn the 30th (August 1833,) the day was oppressively hot,
     and the night exceedingly close, so that no relief could be
     found any where. I rose weary to a degree. By 4 o‚Äôclock, it
     bei g full moon, I set the people off: and when they were
     gone, I had a bathe on the deck, and never experienced the
     force of the expression so sensibly, _As cold water to a
     thirsty soul_; the refreshment was indescribable. I thought
     the next morning to have had a similar enjoyment; but the
     night was cool, and the morning breeze made me shiver, and
     I was glad to escape from the water. Such are the changes
     in this climate!

     ‚ÄúWe could not make Buxar on Saturday: but Sunday,
     Sept. 1st, we arrived at mid-day. At 4 P. M. I went to
     Hindoostanee service, the catechist read the prayers: there
     were twenty women and three men present, besides Mrs. M.
     and her child; she reads the Scriptures to the women,
     when her husband goes on Missionary journies. But few of
     the Europeans attend English service in the forenoon: and
     the numbers in the Hindoostanee congregation are filled
     up as its members are removed by death or otherwise. It
     is reported that the st      is to be abolished as a
     Government post. About twenty children, male and female,
     of European invalids are taught to read and write by a
     sergeant, who officiates as clerk, for which he has twelve
     rupees a month from Government, and the children pay eight
     annas a month. Their proficiency was very moderate. The
     mission as far as I could judge, languishes at this place,
     as at Patna, for want of superintendence by an English
     Missionary. A few of the old faces were there; among them
     Mary Caroll, an interesti g character. She came to my boat
     this morning, and enquired after Mem Sahib, and whether I
     had taken the pension, and were goi g from the country,
     as she heard. She said if Mem had been here, she should
     have got some tea; so I gave her a tea-cup full to take
     home with her. She is feeble and failing, but never misses
     service, and responded cordially to my remarks on the end
     of time, and the love of the Saviour in preparing a place
     for his people. At 6 P. M. the little chapel was full for
     English service, when I officiated to about eighty.

     ‚ÄúAfter evening service I went across the river with M. S.
     and the doctor, and enjoyed a cool refreshi g night in
     his quiet bungalow. This morning early (the 2nd) I came
     over to the pinnace and had much conversation with M.
     on the affairs of the Mission, and gave such advice as
     circumstances seemed to call for. I left him such books and
     transl     s as I had brought and could spare, of which
     he was in great need. I saw also an interesti g young
     convert, baptized three years ago at Lucknow by Mr. Bowley.
     His answers to my questions, on his views of Christian
     truth, were very s   sfactory. As usual he is forsaken by
     his Mahomedan friends, a brother and mother. He teaches
     a school here of fifteen Mahomedan boys, who receives
     Christian instruction from him. M. came over at 8 A. M. and
     we went to breakfast with Colonel Bird. I feel as if my
     visit here was very opportune. May the Lord, even our God,
     grant his blessing, Amen! I know not how I have omitted
     to notice a shock of an earthquake which occurred on the
     night of the 26th August, between 11 and 12. The motion
     continued for hours, and exceedingly alarmed the whole
     country. At 20 minutes before 12 it was most violent; when
     every window shook, and many houses cracked: some of the
     native houses at Patna are thrown down, and some European
     so damaged as to require bei g rebuilt in part. No shock of
     so long continuance has occurred in the memory of man. All
     were roused, and most left their houses for the open air. I
     did not leave my cot; but Mr. R. came and stood by me for
     half an hour, occasionally goi g to comfort his wife and
     mother.

     ‚ÄúOn the evening of September 3rd, a gale came as we reached
     Ghazepore. It blew fresh all the night, but bei g from the
     east we suffered nothing. Mr. T. kindly asked me up; and,
     after breakfasting with the Chaplain on the 4th, I came to
     his splendid abode. It rained hard all the 4th and 5th: in
     the night my cook and baggage-boats were swamped at the
     ghaut opposite the mausoleum. All the school-books and the
     Scriptures, which I was taking up the country, are spoilt.
     Of my own I lost nothing; but am detained over Sunday to
     get another boat. I have visited the school and shall
     preach on Sunday.

     ‚ÄúOn the morning of the 7th, I examined the regimental
     school. There are above 100 boys and girls in one large
     room: the greater part are boys, and the girls who
     attend are of tender age. The exhibition was on a low
     scale in scripture reading and catechism and accounts.
     The commanding officer told me he was aware of the
     comparatively low attainments of the school-master
     sergeant; but he had no one of equally good conduct whom
     he could substitute, and he thought good example of great
     importance to the children. There are but few sick in
     hospital at present; the chaplain told me he visited them
     weekly, and from cot to cot. I had the whole service on the
     morning of the 8th, Mrs. R. bei g unwell. In the evening I
     preached also, and the attendance was very c  siderable,
     as I was told is very usually the case.

     ‚ÄúI arrived at Benares about midday on the 10th; and on
     the 11th early went to the Missionaries of the Church
     Missionary Society to inspect the endowed school in
     the city. There are 149 boys; of these fifty receive
     instruction in English. We began to examine them at six,
     and continued engaged with them till nine. I enclose a
     list[167] of the boys, exhibiting their progress; and in
     respect of the English I have much pleasure in reporting
     most favorably. The pronunciation of the youths is better
     than I have found in any other native school; and the first
     class is really proficient in the subjects enumerated
     opposite their names. A box of books for schools entrusted
     to me by Lady W. Bentinck, supplied some very useful
     rewards, and the youths seemed much gratified with them. I
     regret that from the extreme heat I was unable to attend
     equally to the other department of the school. I merely
     enquired into the nature of the instruction they are
     receiving. They all read the scriptures in the languages
     they learn, and the Hindoostanee teacher would not be
     s   sfied without our waiting to hear his class repeat a
     part of the Christian catechism in use. The school is under
     the immediate charge of Mr. S., and the Rev. Mr. Smith has
     till within the last month frequently given instruction
     in the week. The Rev. Mr. Leupolt has now undertaken that
     charge.

     ‚ÄúOn the morning of the 12th I visited the female school.
     There are eighty in usual attendance; but here I was from
     the heat obliged to confine my attention to the first
     class. This co sists of eighteen, of whom thirteen were
     present. These read in two places of St. Matthew‚Äôs Gospel
     with readiness in Hindee. They read also in Genesis, and
     in a small abridgment of Scripture History. They answered
     questions on the subjects they read intelligently, and
     shewed a fair acquaintance with the leading truths of
     revelation. They repeated with accuracy the Scripture
     catechism in use, and finished with si gi g together a
     Christian hymn. This it seems they at first objected
     to learn; but now they are fond of this part of the
     school-exercises. Specimens of marking both in English and
     Hindee were exhibited, which shew much proficiency.

     ‚ÄúMr. Smith collected the scholars of the three Hindee
     schools at the Mission premises: but from the excessive
     heat I was able to attend to only one school. In this
     about half the number, (fifteen) are reading portions of
     our Scriptures; but the schools have not long been in
     operation, and the proficiency of the boys was accordingly
     small. In c  sequence of the detention at Ghazepore, I
     was unable to give a Sunday both to Benares and Chunar.
     It was agreed therefore that I should preach a Missionary
     Sermon at Benares on Sunday. I went by land to Chunar and
     am happy to say I found Mr. Bowley perfectly restored to
     health, and capable of his usual labours, after having for
     several years seemed decaying. There have been no additions
     of late to the native congregation, though there have
     been several enquirers. Mr. Bowley is at present engaged
     in a correspondence with the chief Molwee at Lucknow,
     who having, as he concluded, discomfitted Mr. Wolff in
     argument, sent his statements to Mr. Bowley, challenging
     him to answer them if he could. It is remarkable that he
     heads his pamphlet (not printed) _Testimonies to Mohammed
     contained in the Christian Scriptures_;--literally, Glad
     tidings of Mohammed from the Prophets and the Gospel. The
     misapplication of his quotations is glaring; but the fact
     of our Scriptures bei g read, though not quite new, is thus
     confirmed.

     ‚ÄúOn the morning of the 14th we visited the boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô
     school; in the former are above forty, and I was glad to
     find that some fine lads, whom I s w here in 1830, have
     found provision at the neighbouring stations as writers,
     &c. The present school co sists of rather small boys. In
     the girls‚Äô school are upwards of sixty; these are much
     attended to by the lady of the Adjutant, and exhibited a
     very s   sfactory proficiency in Scripture knowledge and
     the Catechism; besides bei g well instructed in needle
     work. Mr. E. catechises both boys and girls on Sunday
     mornings in Church before divine service, when some of
     their friends are also present.

     ‚ÄúThe Church Missionary Association is in beneficial
     operation; they raise funds for the support of (I think)
     three readers of the Scriptures, and two native schools.
     On the whole my mind is much set at rest on some points,
     respecting the Mission at Chunar by this visit. The Lord
     grant his blessing!

     ‚ÄúOn Sunday, the 15th September I preached for the Church
     Mission at Benares, and 156 Rs. were collected after the
     sermon. This, co sidering that the Chaplain raises about
     130 Rs. monthly for the support of the native female
     school, was beyond expectation. To faithful labours and
     co sistent character much of the success of the plans for
     assisting the Mission, both here and at Chunar, is to be
     attributed. The state of English society, both at Ghazepore
     and Benares, is very favourable to Christian projects. May
     God raise up, as in due time He no doubt will, suitable
     instruments for extending the knowledge of His saving name!
     On Tuesday morning I passed an hour at sunrise with the
     Missionary brethren in reading and prayer, and came away to
     Juanpore in the evening.

     ‚ÄúAt this place is a pretty little Church in the Gothic
     style. There are three principal residents, by whom
     chiefly the funds have been raised. Lady William it seems
     kindly s id to Mr. B. at Allahabad, when told of this
     undertaking, that she would pay for glazing the windows;
     this has been done and 120 Rs. are owing, besides which
     220 Rs. were due for partial pewing. On Sunday, September
     22nd, I officiated in this pretty building. The advantage
     of having an appropriate place for divine service was
     never more manifest than here. In the morning the whole
     Christian community assembled, in number thirty-five; of
     these fourteen remained to partake of the Lord‚Äôs Supper.
     In the evening there were twenty present, and about this
     number usually assembled on Sundays twice a day, when the
     judge, collector, and commanding officer officiate in turn,
     reading the service of the Church, and a printed sermon.
     These three families meet also for social worship at each
     other‚Äôs houses on Thursd   evenings. There is a Catechist
     of the Church Missionary Society at Jaunpore. His name
     is Mirza Yusuf Bukir, a son of the celebrated traveller,
     Abu Talib Khan. This man resided at Allahabad when Mr. W.       Bird was there, and obtained from him a New Testament in
     Persian, and occasionally asked of Mr. Bird explanations
     of passages. This led to his conversion. He now instructs
     the Christians connected with the native regiment at
     Jaunpore, and reads the scriptures to the servants of two
     families. Mr. Brown derives assistance from him also in
     translating tracts for circulation, when his public duties
     allow him any leisure, which is seldom. I had the pleasure
     to baptize Mirza‚Äôs wife on the 24th, after several years
     of refusal to receive the Christian religion. This shews
     his perseverance; and all the friends at the station bear
     testimony to his consistent piety; though it is thought
     he has not sufficient employment where he is, and I wrote
     to Dr. C. at Patna on the subject of his bei g employed
     there, to which Mirza perfectly agrees. A youth taught in
     the Church Missionary school at Benares will, I expect,
     be entertained in the native college at Jaunpore as a
     teacher of English. It was at one time in contemplation to
     have placed him in a school in connexion with the Church
     Missionary Society; but there not bei g sufficient funds at
     disposal, it was determined to have English taught in the
     native institution, for here, as every where, the people
     are desirous of education in English.

     ‚ÄúMy bodily strength is considerably renewed; but the
     co f   ment of the boat, equally with _dawk_ travelling,
     has prevented my deriving all the benefit I trust I may now
     hope for, at least on reaching Cawnpore. I am preparing a
     different route to that which we talked of together. By the
     one then proposed I could, if health held out, by scarcely
     intermitting a day of travelling or visiti g schools, reach      Bombay by the middle of March, and then, if a ship be ready
     to sail, reach Calcutta by the end of April or early in
     May. But unless duty called, Bombay would be out of my way;
     and I cannot but own that the spirit of enterprise has much
     departed from me. I shall now propose to go from Cawnpore
     to Saugor (not included in the former plan) expecting
     to be there the second Sunday in November; at Mhow the
     first Sunday in December; Neemuch the third in December;
     Nuseerabad at Christmas; Agra the first or second Sunday in
     January; then Muttra, Delhi, Meerut, Kurnaul, and to the
     snowy mountains during April, May and till the middle of
     June; return by Meerut, Fettyguhr, and the Ganges, so as
     to reach Calcutta in July, or early in August. This would
     not make my absence from Calcutta above three months longer
     than in the former scheme, and would keep me upon my own
     ground; and in the hills I should have useful employment.       But in the view of such a journey I cannot but feel how
     appropriate the language of the Apostle is, If the Lord
     will? I do trust my resolves are all formed in that spirit,
     and I often do feel that a reconciled God is near at hand.
     If the Bishop could but make this tour I should expect God
     would greatly bless his visits. I find every where some who
     seem waiti g for the kingdom of God, and a few who love and
     live on the Gospel of our Saviour. A marvellous change in
     public feeling has certainly taken place among the upper
     classes of our countrymen, in respect of the disposition
     to favour good plans. It seems a pity that their means
     of supporti g such plans should be shortened just now. I
     was expecting the society of a valued young friend from
     Cawnpore to Mhow, when behold! the youth has found for
     himself a wife; and the lady cannot travel such long stages
     as I must make. I must therefore proceed alone, with my own
     thoughts to keep me company. I leave this, D.V. on Monday
     evening by land, having left my pinnace here: I intend to
     stay over the heat of Tuesday at a staging bungalow; go
     forty miles to Futtypore, where are Christian friends; stay
     with them till Thursday evening, and proceed to Cawnpore so
     as to arrive by Friday to breakfast.

     ‚ÄúOn the 25th September, I arrived at Allahabad, and on the
     26th went to breakfast with the Chaplain; and afterwards
     with him visited and examined the school in the fort.       There are twenty boys and eight or ten girls receiving
     instruction: of these eight or ten are orphans, and their
     schooli g is paid for out of the sacramental and other
     collections: and also paper, pens, and books are supplied
     to the school. The other children pay three and half
     Rs. each a month, as remuneration to the teachers. The
     proficiency of the children was very moderate, except in
     the Church Catechism, in which about twelve of them gave
     ready and intelligent answers to questions. There, as at
     other stations, the reward-books supplied to me by Lady
     William were gladly received. On the 28th, I was unwell,
     and obliged to lie by. On the 29th, towards evening I
     examined the native girls‚Äô school, where several ladies of
     the station met me. By the care of friends here a large
     compound close upon the bazaar has been obtained, and a
     very commodious school-room erected from funds raised on
     the spot. This was the first time the school was used,
     nineteen girls were present, all children of Mahomedans! It
     is expected that the number of children will not increase.       Of those present ten read with fluency any part of the
     Hindoostanee New Testament, and repeated correctly the
     Hindoostanee catechism in use. The school is under the
     care of an officer‚Äôs widow, assisted by a poor woman, who
     teaches the lower classes.

     ‚ÄúA catechist of the Church Missionary Society is also
     stationed here, named David Batavia, originally from
     Ceylon. He reads prayers with the Native Christians in the
     invalid lines, amounting to from ten to fifteen; and also
     to about the same number of christians of the same class
     in the fort. He goes about from time to time distributing
     tracts, and conversing with the natives about Christianity.       His piety and benevolence are admitted by all who know
     him, but no extensive good has yet appeared to result from
     his labours. He resides in a house which was given to the
     Church Missionary Society, by the Rev. Mr. Crauford, when
     he was Chaplain here. The house is well situated for a
     Missionary‚Äôs residence. On Sunday morning we had Divine
     Service in the garrison at six. There is now only one
     Company of Artillery here, and of these many are Roman
     Catholics; so that only about forty were present: but the
     conductors and others connected with the magazine, who
     with their families reside in the fort, exceed sixty; and
     with a few from cantonments made a congregation of about
     100. I preached in the morning, and in the evening at the
     circuit bungalow, where upwards of thirty attended. The
     partition-wall in this bungalow is about to be removed,
     when it will be much more commodious for public worship
     than in its present state, and it is expected more will
     attend. On Sunday evening last--those who came late could
     with difficulty be seated. The situation of the ground
     about the fort is below the level of the Ganges during the
     rains. The river is kept out by an embankment, which was
     this year in danger of giving way. The ground is thus low
     for a distance of about two miles from the fort, where on
     a rising ground the Military Cantonments and Civilians‚Äô
     houses are situated. No Church could therefore be erected
     nearer than about two miles from the fort. A vacant space
     may there be found close to the circuit bungalow, the
     nearest point to the fort. So that there must always be two
     congregations at this station. Mr. R. Bird has in   med you
     of the numbers and growi g importance of Allahabad; as a
     Missionary station it is become of very great importance.
     A numerous and wealthy population reside in the bazars,
     engaged extensively in trade; and the town being at the
     junction of the rivers Ganges and Jumna, will increase in
     proportion as the country is prosperous. The numbers who
     now resort to the Board of Revenue and to the Sudder Court
     will give opportunity of circulating the glad tidings over
     all upper India; and Mr. L‚Äôs experience at Monghir has led
     me to build much on this resort of strangers.

     ‚ÄúFuttypore, October 3rd. At this station there are only
     four government servants; and only one of them married.       The judge and doctor are old acquaintances of mine, and I
     am staying a day to break the journey to Cawnpore, where I
     hope to arrive to-morrow morning. A school is maintained
     by these few residents here, the medical man giving a good
     deal of his time to it, and also to a hospital where many
     sick poor are attended to: the expense of this is also
     maintained by friends on the spot. The population being
     to a considerable extent Mohamedan, the school is not so
     well attended as is desirable. I visited it this morning:
     there were thirty boys present; of these six have made some
     proficiency in English under a native, educated in the
     school at Cawnpore. His proficiency is very moderate, and
     his scholars accordingly come on slowly. They were reading
     the 3rd chapter of St. Matthew, having with much patience
     and good management been brought to read our Scriptures. At
     first much opposition was made to their introduction. They
     are aware, they say, that from reading these books people
     become Christians. Here as every where the field is open
     for Missionary labour.

     ‚ÄúI have here met with an officer who has travelled the
     route I mentioned a few days since by Saugor to Mhow,
     Neemuch, Nuseerabad, and Agra. I was apprehensive that
     there might be dense jungle to pass through, and danger
     from malaria; but he tells me the country is pretty well
     cultivated, and that there is no jungle to speak of; that
     the aspect of the country, moreover, is interesting, much
     beyond these level plains. I seem therefore fixed in that
     plan. I shall be ready to leave Cawnpore, I conclude, by
     the last week in October; and will send before I proceed, a
     detailed account of the progress I expect to make.

     ‚ÄúI leave here the young Baboo who accompanied me, and whose
     conduct has been uni   mly Christian and correct.

     ‚ÄúI arrived at Cawnpore on the morning of the 4th October.
     From the wish not to lose time, I had left my boat at
     Allahabad and proceeded _dawk_, as I had to that place from
     Benares, via Jaunpore.

     ‚ÄúThis mode of travelling made me very unwell, and prevented
     for a whole week my taking so active a part as I otherwise
     might have done. I was also prevented visiting Lucknow,
     which I could have done only by _dawk_. I wrote however
     to Mr. Greenwood for in   mation. He also came over for a
     day to Cawnpore, and represented his situation at Lucknow
     as pleasant and his prospects as encouraging. He receives
     every attention and aid which Christian kindness can
     devise, from the chief authorities there.

     ‚ÄúOctober 6. I attended Divine service at the church
     bungalow, and stood up once more in Martyn‚Äôs pulpit. The
     place is a little enlarged, by adding the portion where
     the communion-table stood, to the body of the building,
     and adding another space to which the communion-table has
     been removed: and also a small vestry. I was rather late
     from the distance of Mr. W‚Äôs. bungalow, and this prevented
     my mind, in going, from dwelling on the well-known scene,
     and by-gone experience. The congregation was full and
     attentive, and my mind a good deal solemnized by the
     service. So that on returning, the remembrance of Martyn,
     and the Sherwoods and Mary, with the occupations of that
     period, came powerfully to my recollection, and I could not
     prevent the tears from flowing rather plentifully. They
     were not, however, tears of regret altogether, for joys
     departed. A sense of much short-coming in duty mixed in my
     feelings; and the forgiving love of God, with the prospect      of all joining in thankful adoration in the realms of
     bliss, greatly preponderated. I almost involuntarily began
     to sing:--

            ‚ÄúThy mercy, my God, is the theme of my song.‚Äù

     ‚ÄúThe two Chaplains at Cawnpore perform their public service      on Sundays at the riding-school of the Lancers, where the
     horse and foot Artillery also attend, and at the church
     bungalow, where H. M. Infantry regiment attends, and the
     civil servants and other inhabitants of the station. This
     duty the Chaplains take alternately. Evening service is
     always held in the church bungalow at half an hour after
     sun set; and this duty the Chaplains divide between them.
     Besides this there is an evening service on Tuesdays
     at the Magazine, for the families connected with that
     departm      n Wednesday evening in the small chapel on Mr.
     W‚Äôs premises, where many of the riding-school congregation
     attend, and on Thursday evening in a large room near the
     Infantry barracks. On Sunday evening also there is evening
     service in the chapel of Mr. W‚Äôs premises.

     ‚ÄúThe attendance on these occasions is generally full,
     especially at the church bungalow on Sunday evenings, when
     a very considerable number of the upper classes, as well
     as others, are regularly present. I officiated at all
     these places, except the riding-school: being prevented
     by illness from going out the Sunday I was at liberty for
     that service. On Sunday, the 20th, I preached in the church
     bungalow in behalf of the mission here, when 695 Rs. were
     collected and 100 Rs. sent afterwards, besides some blank
     tickets, which would make the collection upwards of 1000
     Rs.

     ‚ÄúThere is an establishment at Cawnpore called the Free
     School, established and partly maintained by private
     contributions; and to which Government allows 400 Rs. a
     month. In this there are at present seventy-two children
     learning English, of whom eighteen are christians who
     are boarded and clothed also from the funds. There is a
     Persian class, and also a Sanscrit class. Those who learn
     English all learn together according to their proficiency.
     Several native youths have become qualified in this school
     for public offices, and have obtained situations of
     considerable emolument.

     ‚ÄúConnected with the mission are four schools, superintended
     by different friends, who take an interest in them. These
     have each an English class, as well    scholars who learn
     Hindoostanee or Persian. About 250 of these boys assembled
     in the church bungalow on the morning of the 12th. I was      obliged to confine the examination to the English classes,
     which occupied us from sunrise till after nine. The first
     class of the Free School boys had made the greatest
     progress, and their pronunciation of English was very
     correct; but the best boys had been provided for in various
     ways lately, so that those present had not advanced far. A
     few of them had some knowledge of grammar, and could point      out with readiness the position of countries and remarkable
     places on the globe. The boys of the magazine school were
     next in proficiency, and a class in Hindoostanee read
     with admirable accuracy and readiness portions in the
     Hindoostanee New Testament, which they at the same time
     translated. The Rev. Mr. C. officiates in Hindoostanee at
     the church bungalow, at 4 P. M. on Sundays and Thursdays. I
     attended on one occasion; there were six men and six women,
     which constitute the chief of his regular congregation. A
     catechist, brought up by Mr. Bowley, has been stationed
     here about three years. He goes into the bazaar almost
     daily to converse with his countrymen on the important      subject of religion. He is spoken of as maintaining a
     steady christian character. He officiates as clerk to Mr.
     C. and reads the chapter, which Mr. C. expounds after
     prayers.

     ‚ÄúI examined the school of H. M. 44th, which is in the
     best condition by far of any school I have seen during
     this journey: the general reading and knowledge of the
     English language, the acquaintance with English history,
     and accuracy in dates, the proficiency in geography and
     arithmetic of the first class of the boys, consisting of
     seven, was exceedingly pleasing. Three of them also read
     Hindoostanee. The first class of girls also were very
     well instructed, and these classes, as well as the lower      ones, were all well  cquainted with the Church Catechism.
     There were 100 of both sexes. The school of the Lancers
     consists of about seventy; their proficiency was not so
     good, having been interrupted by sickness. The mortality of
     this station has been great this year, beyond most other
     seasons. The heat both for intenseness and continuance
     has this year been unusual. The register between July and
     September exhibits a list of 224 buried. The children of
     the regiments have been carried off to a great amount. On
     account of this sickness the duty of visiting the hospital
     came heavily upon the chaplains, especially on Mr. W., as
     these visits were mostly made during the day, when his
     colleague was unable to go out in the heat. A considerable
     seriousness has been wrought in the minds of the generality
     at the station by the mortality around, in connection with
     the labors of the chaplains. The attendance at the Lord‚Äôs      Table, one of the Sundays I was there, amounted to 115, of
     whom ten were native Christians; and it was said not to be
     a large communion.

     ‚ÄúThe collections on these occasions are liberal, beyond
     what is found at most other stations. The subject of
     missions for several years past has been brought frequently
     to the notice of the congregation, and a box with two
     openings is carried round to collect the offerings at
     the communion;--one marked _Missionary_, the other
     _Charitable_. The collection is usually about 200 Rs.
     and stated congregational collections are also made. A
     charitable committee has been formed some time; also a
     Missionary committee. The charitable committee relieves
     weekly between 400 and 500 poor: the Missionary committee
     have in hand now about 10,000 Rs.

     ‚ÄúIt is not decided what kind of Missionary Institution
     shall be established, or in what manner it is proposed to
     conduct it. The want of schoolmasters qualified to teach
     English is, however, becoming manifest, and any plan which
     would supply this want would be deserving of warm support.
     It is not in the first instance a Missionary, so much as
     a schoolmaster, that is called for in a variety of places
     at this time: men who would teach grammatically on a small
     allowance. The free-school at Cawnpore might serve as the
     lower branch of such an establishment. At present, as soon
     as qualified to earn from 20 Rs. a month and upwards, the      scholars leave school. A plan must therefore be adopted
     to retain promising youths till they become sufficiently
     instructed to instruct others.

     ‚ÄúI was requested by the Chaplain to state particularly the
     condition of the station libraries. During his Government,
     Lord Hastings induced the Court of Directors to send
     out a library to each station of European troops. These
     were mostly supplied according to a list Lord Hastings
     himself sent home, and are generally speaking of a useful
     tendency. No additions have, however, been made to the list
     first supplied, and some additional supplies are greatly
     needed. In the Infantry regiment the commanding officer
     has encouraged the resort of the soldiers to the reading
     room, and a considerable spirit of reading and improvement
     prevails in H. M. 44th. The soldiers, assisted by the      officers, have added, I believe, to the Government stock;
     and many of the soldiers‚Äô wives have benefitted also by
     the Library:--a circumstance too unusual hitherto in the
     army. The appointment of Librarian, and also the care of
     the books, was originally assigned by Government to the
     Chaplains of stations, but this order has not been properly
     attended to.

     ‚ÄúIn the Cavalry Corps at Cawnpore, the public library has
     not been encouraged, and on Government determining to
     erect a new reading-room, the Chaplains were not consulted
     as to the site or dimensions. The situation of the new
     reading-room is not considered favorable for the resort      of the soldiers, and no less than 6000 Rs. have been
     expended, when a room of half the cost would have equally
     answered the purpose. If Government were to republish
     the order placing the station libraries under the charge      of the Chaplains, and to order that in all arrangements
     respecting the libraries and schools and the rooms for
     them, the Chaplain should be of the Committee, it would
     conduce greatly to the efficiency of these institutions;
     and if either from public or private sources a few suitable
     books were from time to time added to the existing stock,
     it would tend greatly to keep up a spirit of reading among
     the soldiers.‚Äù

From Cawnpore, the Archdeacon proceeded to Banda. He arrived at
that place on the evening of Saturday, Oct. 26, and on the Monday
following received letters from the Bishop of Calcutta, informing him
that it was the intention of the authorities in England, to appoint
him to the Bishopric of Bombay, which an act passed this year for the
renewal of the East India Company‚Äôs Charter, had enabled his majesty,
King William IV., to erect. The directions of the Bishop also were,
that the Archdeacon should forthwith return to the presidency,
preparatory to his proceeding to England. The intelligence which
the Bishop of Calcutta conveyed, was altogether unexpected by the Archdeacon, and occasioned him some embarrassment. The calls upon
his pecuniary resources had of late been many, what with the charges
attendant on the education of his children, and his wife‚Äôs voyages
to England, added to some loss by the failure of a house of agency.
Unless, therefore, government should provide for the expenses, which
a voyage to England, for consecration, would entail upon him, he
could scarcely avoid contracting some debt for the time; and that
he felt would scarcely be right for him to risk, at his period of
life. These, and other considerations which were likely to affect
the future welfare of his family, the Archdeacon candidly stated to
the Bishop of Calcutta in a letter from Banda, in which he further
observes:--

     ‚ÄúI turn my face toward Calcutta to-morrow, D.V. I had
     reached just the border of my former local knowledge, and      should have been very unwilling to give up the prospect
     before me had I proceeded much further. I had taken no
     measures directly or indirectly towards the attainment of
     the honor and responsibility in question; and trust I may
     hope that God will guide and second my poor endeavours to
     serve the Church according to His will. If then I say I
     turn toward Calcutta with some reluctance, it is merely
     lest what I have stated should prevent my going to England.
     If prevented going, the omission of visiting the remaining
     stations would be in vain, and the loss sustained for no
     good purpose. For, little as I feel capable of effecting,
     yet good will I am persuaded follow these passing visits.

     ‚ÄúOur Church goes on her way, doing what she can; too
     secure, perhaps, that her endeavors are generally known
     and appreciated. Those who separate from us tell all
     they do, and seem sometimes to make much of little. To
     those at a distance they however seem the only people at      work, and in consequence are applied to for books and for
     information on missionary subjects, and for missionaries
     and school-masters. Mr. D. for instance, has been applied
     to, to supply a teacher at Allahabad; and at Banda he was
     applied to in the first instance to supply a teacher at
     Futtypore. In visiting the stations, I see almost every one      who is disposed to take an interest in missions, schools,
     &c. They have almost all been educated in Church-of-England
     principles and modes of worship, and would all prefer
     receiving aid from us, and remaining connected with the
     Establishment. These visits bring them acquainted with what
     is doing among their own friends. They will learn where to
     look for help, such as they can in all respects approve. In
     this way some, who were inclined to good, are led to come
     forward openly, and the cause of truth and righteousness
     gathers strength. The disposition to establish schools is
     increasing everywhere; and if half a dozen teachers could
     be got at once, they might be set to work. With reference
     to this subject the High School might become an important
     Institution, and would be well employed in educating some
     of the best boys with the expectation of being useful as      school-masters.

     ‚ÄúI must travel to Allahabad by land, which will occupy
     about ten days; and then I shall hire a boat to proceed
     downwards. A letter is ten days reaching Calcutta from
     this; so that a few lines, if you see cause for changing my
     course, would meet me at Benares. I could even then return
     to Saugor by a more direct route, and pursue the plan
     before intended with the loss of not more than a month. I
     have made observations in my progress with reference to
     future visitations, which I intend to commit to writing      with a view to aid in enabling to do more good.‚Äù

To the same prelate he writes:--

     ‚ÄúNov. 12th, 1823, near Gazeepore. On arriving at Benares
     yesterday morning, I found your favor of the 5th inst.

     ‚ÄúAt Benares I was not less than 200 miles from the point      whence I returned; I should therefore, had I delayed at
     Benares, have been able to march straight to the hills,
     without time to accomplish any thing at intermediate
     stations. I think therefore you will approve of my coming
     on at once to Calcutta, as I am now doing. I could not have
     borne so long a journey by _dawk_. I passed Sunday last at
     Chunar, and took part of the duty with Mr. E.; Mr. Smith
     officiated twice at Benares.

     ‚ÄúI am happy to state that Messrs. Knorpp and Leupolt are

                             CHAPTER XX.

     DELAY IN HIS NOMINATION TO THE BISHOPRIC--NARROW ESCAPE
       FROM DEATH--SUMMONED TO ENGLAND--VISITS THE CAPE AND ST.
       HELENA--HIS CONSECRATION--INTERVIEW WITH THE KING--ARRIVAL
       IN MADRAS--VISIT TO TANJORE AND TINNEVELLY.


The Archdeacon arrived in Calcutta, from his visitation, on the 30th
of November 1833. He there learned, it seems, that his probable
destination had been changed; for in writing to Mr. Sherer, he
observes--

     ‚ÄúYou are aware of the intention of those in power,
     respecting my being appointed to Madras. I have not sought,
     and may therefore, I trust, receive the appointment as from
     God, and expect Him to guide and uphold me in the duties
     of it. To have gone home without so public a designation,      would, in some sense, have been more agreeable to me;       expecting, as I must, to be often called before the public:
     but to have taken ‚Äòsweet counsel‚Äô once more with you and my
     family would have been a great gratification. Should the
     appointment take place here, it will be like taking a final
     adieu of you all, as it respects the life that now is.‚Äù

It appears, however, that for several months he received no further
communications on the subject of the Bishopric. Thus he writes

                             TO HIS WIFE.

                                                   ‚ÄúFeb. 6, 1834.

     ‚ÄúI have received several letters from various quarters on
     my rumoured preferment. In the mean time, I hear no more
     on the subject. I am not, however, in the least anxious. I
     am _sure_ whatever be God‚Äôs will must be best. I have no
     reluctance to remain here.‚Äù

The Archdeacon was now, in fact, on board a pilot-schooner, cruising in the bay of Bengal, with a view to recover himself from the effects
of a bad cold. From thence he writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúThe renewal of the East India Company‚Äôs Charter promises
     great and important changes for this country. They are all
     intended by the framers of the Bill; without any regard
     to religion in any form. How far God will overrule this      proceeding in rulers professedly Christian, remains to be
     seen. Certain it is that great changes have already taken      place, in both European and Native Society. In the latter,
     any real good has been effected through God‚Äôs blessing on
     missionary exertions. To this, Government in former days      was opposed; now it is not so: and we require only men and
     support, to spread the christian knowledge far and wide;       and we do hope Divine Providence is favouring the purpose,       and will supply the means. As to our European Society, a
     friend who was with us lately from Madras, says, that in
     all the Society, chiefly mercantile, he came in contact      with whilst with me, he saw or heard nothing in general
     offensive to christian feeling. This from a stranger, and
     one capable of judging, speaks well for Calcutta. Indeed,
     at this time, every pulpit in Calcutta, and the adjoining      stations, is supplied with a faithful preacher; and the      example of our beloved Bishop makes even the timid bold ‚Äòto
     declare the whole counsel of God.‚Äô‚Äù


                            TO HIS SISTER.

                                                  ‚ÄúMarch 4, 1834.

     ‚ÄúBefore this reaches you, my destination will be fixed.
     If not removed from this presidency, it is probable my
     residence henceforth will be at Agra, the seat of the new
     residency, as next in authority to the Bishop, who will
     continue at Calcutta. In either case, the prospect of you
     and I meeting again, is removed to a distance I do not      like to let my mind dwell upon. When I recur to Stoke,       a thousand overpowering recollections crowd upon me....
     For myself, my days have passed as a dream. I have had
     much enjoyment, but seem not to have accomplished any one
     thing as I might have done. I was beginning to anticipate
     much enjoyment in the society of Sherer and my brothers,
     but that seems to be deferred for a season, if it ever
     arrive. The anxieties attendant on domestic life have been
     comparatively few. The loss of children I now contemplate
     as a gracious appointment, fixing by a process at the time      painful, two olive-branches in the Paradise of God; and
     if it please God, that Eliza and the children reach me in
     safety, no earthly care will more, I think disturb me. Yet      I know cares will arrive, but as my day is, strength will
     be vouchsafed.‚Äù

In the month following the date of the foregoing letter, Archdeacon
Corrie had a narrow escape from death by drowning. The circumstances
attending the danger to which he was exposed, are thus related by
himself in a letter


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

                                          ‚ÄúCalcutta, May 6, 1834.

     ‚ÄúI may mention that on the 22nd ult. J. Jackson and I set      off to go to Ishipore, or the Government powder-mills.
     Through the kindness of a friend in the Military Board, the      use of a house there had been assigned me, for two months,
     near to our valued friend Major Powney; and we were going
     to take possession. We proceeded in a _bholiah_,[168] with      a fair wind, and had reached opposite the grove, when an
     alarm was given that the _Bore_[169] was coming in. John
     and I had just time to get from under the cover, when, sure      enough, a foaming breaker was close astern. The first wave
     the boat surmounted, but then ‚Äòbroaching to,‚Äô as sailors
     say, the second wave turned her bottom upwards. John and
     I and all the people, ten in number, were plunged into
     the deep. I for some time could not rise, and swallowed a
     good deal of water, when I providentially became involved
     in the sail, by the aid of which I reached the surface;       and my servant (Wahid) who was swimming in search of me,      presently seized my arm and drew me towards the boat, which      was floating up with the tide; and by degrees I got upon
     her keel. John had some difficulty also, in reaching the
     boat; and we were picked up by a friendly Indigo-planter,
     who himself narrowly escaped. He gave me a blanket, which      prevented cold, and at Tittagur, we got from Mr. Bateman,
     at the Bishop‚Äôs country-house, a change of clothes, and
     in the evening we returned by land without suffering any
     inconvenience whatever. The news somehow got abroad, and I
     have received much sympathy, and more tokens of interest in
     my fate than I expected. The danger was imminent, but was
     over in a few minutes.‚Äù

In a memorandum penned on the day following that on which this
accident occurred, after reciting the foregoing particulars
respecting it, the Archdeacon adds:--

     ‚ÄúOn finding myself below the flood the thought occurred,
     ‚ÄòIs my end come?‚Äô But I do not recollect that any
     ejaculation or any cry for help escaped me. Afterward in
     Mr. P‚Äôs boat there appeared danger from the roughness of
     the weather, when I did refer myself to God, to be disposed      of according to His will, without reservation. I have this
     morning before day, solemnly called my ways to remembrance
     before God, and have solemnly ‚Äòreceived the Atonement,‚Äô
     if I never received it before; desiring to receive Christ
     as my sanctification, as well as my righteousness; having
     proof even since this event, that unless He sanctify as      well as justify me, I shall remain unholy still.‚Äù

During the month of July, Mrs. Corrie and her daughters reached
Calcutta in safety, and in the meanwhile the Archdeacon had received
directions to proceed to England for consecration. He observed in a
letter addressed, on the 24th of June


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúA few days, since, I received from Mr. Grant an official
     notice of my nomination as Bishop of Bombay, and
     desiring me to come home for consecration at my earliest
     convenience. I have received a verbal consent from the      chiefs in authority here also, to send me home on service      with the same allowance I now have, till I enter on my new      appointment.... I will say nothing of the prospect before
     me, but that I feel rather depressed than elevated by it.
     Bombay is as new to me as it would be to you, except that I      know what it is to bear this climate and people.‚Äù

It was found, however, that the Indian authorities had no power to
allow the Archdeacon to receive his present stipend until he should
enter on his new appointment. The reason indeed why the Government
at home could give no definite instructions until now, respecting
the Archdeacon‚Äôs movements was, that although the provisions of the
new charter allowed of his appointment to one of the additional
bishoprics, it decided also that his stipend as Archdeacon should
thereupon cease, and that his allowance as Bishop should not commence until he actually landed in India, to exercise the duties of his
office there. But as under such circumstances he felt called upon
to decline the office, it was in contemplation to send out a bishop
from England who, in conjunction with the bishop of Calcutta, should
consecrate the third bishop in India. The difficulty alluded to
having however been surmounted, the Archdeacon writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

                                                 ‚ÄúAugust 4, 1834.

     ‚ÄúI am happy in the prospect of enjoying your society for      a season again. I think we shall correspond with more
     intimate, though I scarcely conceive we can with warmer,
     feeling than before. My heart has always clung to the idea      of brothers and sister as, next to wife and children, the
     strongest tie to earth: and my visit home will, I am sure,      only strengthen this feeling. I wrote to H. in May, of
     my expectation of coming home in September. Some rumours
     had led me lately to conclude that I might be spared the
     journey and voyage; but last week I received a notification
     from the Commissioners for Indian affairs, that His Majesty
     has granted me a pension of ¬£800 a year, to be drawn only
     when deriving no emolument from ecclesiastical preferment
     in India. This we conclude Mr. Grant meant as a supply for      the expences of visiting England for consecration. It is
     all he can do; and the Court of Directors are altogether so
     opposed to the increase of [the number of] Bishops, that
     they will afford no aid whatever.... I expect to embark in
     October. It was in October last that I was first informed      of the preferment intended for me, but till June last, had
     no certainty: and now the difficulties by sea and land, and
     especially the separation from family, render the prospect
     far from cheering. I do not pretend to be insensible to
     the distinction implied in being a bishop, though heartily
     glad that no ‚ÄòLordship‚Äô is connected with it in this
     instance.[170] I know Indian society well; and know that
     from the familiarity with which all in the service mix,
     from the Ensign or Writer of six months standing, to the      General or grave Judge of the Circuit, that a man coming      with a title is viewed with much jealousy: and unless, like      Heber, he make himself one with them, whilst every sentence      he utters proves his mental superiority, he will rather be
     shunned than sought. As it is, whilst I seek not theirs‚Äô
     but them, I may, as in time past, be permitted to do a
     little good in my way.‚Äù

Archdeacon Corrie had made every preparation for proceeding to
England, intending that Mrs. C. and his daughters should remain
in India; but the health of his wife began so decidedly to fail
again, that the medical men peremptorily decided that her only human
chance of recovery was from a voyage to the Cape. This unforeseen
domestic trial prevented the Archdeacon from embarking so soon as
was originally arranged; but on the 12th of November he quitted the
shores of Bengal in the ship ‚ÄúExmouth.‚Äù It pleased God to grant him
a prosperous voyage to the Cape, where he arrived with his family
on the 13th of January 1835. After a stay there of some days, the
Archdeacon embarked for England, taking with him his eldest daughter,
the rest of his family remaining at the Cape. In a memorandum dated Feb. 13th. he remarks:--

     ‚ÄúWe left St. Helena yesterday evening about 7 o‚Äôclock, and
     have thus far had a fair and favouring wind. On the 11th
     I went with Anna to visit Napoleon‚Äôs grave. The spot is
     sequestered, and might well attract his notice in life.      He used frequently to retire, and read under the trees
     which now overshadow his tomb. Great was the kindness      of the English Government towards him; but his restless      mind could take pleasure only in troubled scenes. He was
     a great instrument in breaking down old barriers to the
     progress of Divine truth. May God in mercy supply the means      of establishing His truth, on the Continent of Europe
     and in all the earth! I received much civility from the      Governor, His Majesty‚Äôs Commissioners and others. Only
     one Chaplain in the island, and he sickly. The population
     is about 5,000. There is a good deal doing in the way of
     schools. A Free-school contains one hundred and twenty
     boys; Plantation day-school fifty-five boys, and twenty-two
     girls. Four evening schools ninety-two: four girls‚Äô
     Day-schools, fifty-seven: Hutsgate, twenty-six. In all, 512
     children, of whom sixty-nine are supported by Government,
     and sixty-eight boys, and twenty-five girls by the
     Benevolent Society. There are about 300 Chinese settlers;
     industrious, but ignorant. For these a school-master is to
     be recommended by His Majesty‚Äôs Commissioners. Mr. Brook,
     however, told me, that they have families by the race of
     mixed blood, and that their children go to school and
     become identified with their mother‚Äôs class. The labours      of the Chaplain are too much for his health: another is
     greatly needed.‚Äù

On Tuesday April 7, the Archdeacon and his daughter landed at Dover
from the ‚ÄòExmouth,‚Äô slept at Canterbury, and proceeded the next day
to London, where he was cordially welcomed by Mrs. Wilberforce Bird,
the daughter of his valued friend, the late Rev. David Brown. He
remarks in a memorandum, dated April 12th.--

     ‚ÄúI have been prospered hitherto in all my expectations.      I have endeavoured to pray for pardon and grace to guide      me--all that I have aimed at hitherto, has succeeded.
     May I be enabled to receive the good, so as not to be
     elated and so grieve the Holy Spirit to leave me to
     darkness and corruption.... The views on the way to town      were enlivening on all sides. Multitudes of small, most
     comfortable dwellings, well deserving the name of    The      happy homes of England;‚Äô besides the stately houses
     scattered up and down: whilst increasing buildings at every
     place, indicate high prosperity, and give an appearance of
     comfort that goes to the heart. But comfort is inseparable      from duty, and my duty seems to call me away from these      fair scenes to a literally and spiritually, ‚Äòdry and barren
     land.‚Äô May God but go with me, for he can open springs in
     the desert.‚Äù

In obedience, therefore, to the calls of duty, the Archdeacon did not
consider himself at liberty to remain in England longer than might
be absolutely necessary for accomplishing the object of his voyage.
Within a few days, therefore, of his arrival in London, he waited upon the Archbishop of Canterbury, to receive his Grace‚Äôs directions
respecting such matters as might be preliminary to consecration.
The Melbourne administration having, however, just at that time
returned to power, the unsettled state of things consequent upon a
change of Ministry, occasioned some delay in the preparation of the
official documents connected with the defining of the boundaries &c. of the diocese of Madras, to which see the Archdeacon had ultimately
been nominated. In the meanwhile, the Archdeacon took occasion
to communicate with the Committees of the religious Societies in
connection with the Church; and had the happiness to receive from
all, the assurance of their willingness to aid him to the utmost
of their power, in furthering his plans for the good of his future
diocese. All the time that was not taken up by such necessary
occupations as these, he spent with his surviving relations and
friends. His oldest and most valued friend, Mr. Buckworth, he was not
permitted again to meet on earth; for that servant of God died during
the very week, in which the Archdeacon reached the shores of England.

It was whilst visiting his relatives that Archdeacon Corrie writes


                             TO HIS WIFE.

                                                   ‚ÄúJune 5, 1835.

     ‚ÄúI have now to tell you that the Archbishop has fixed
     Trinity Sunday, as the day for my consecration. On the 14th
     instant, I expect, therefore, if the Lord will, to be set
     apart as Bishop of Madras. This news I received yesterday;
     and I awoke this morning with such an oppressive feeling
     of the case, as to compel me to arise and pray for relief.      The Saviour‚Äôs grace can render me even an instrument of
     good; and in this consideration alone I find any thing like
     repose.‚Äù

Before returning to London, the Archdeacon visited Cambridge, and was there admitted to his Doctor‚Äôs degree, by royal mandate, on the 11th
of June. He proceeded to London on the following day.

The day appointed for his consecration having arrived, he was
admitted to the episcopate by the Archbishop, assisted by the Bishops of Lichfield, Carlisle, and Bangor; the preacher on the occasion
being the Rev. Josiah Pratt. In a memorandum, in which Dr. Corrie
noted down the particulars of the servic   n which he had been
engaged, he remarks:--

     ‚ÄúI awoke in the morning at four o‚Äôclock, and set myself to
     prayer. I then read in the Epistles to Timothy,[171] and
     the Hebrews, with a view to the servic  before me, and was      enabled to realiz   n a small degree the pardoning mercy
     of God, and to hope for grace in all time to come. I then
     asked for mercies suited to my apprehension of my present
     state; for relatives and friends; and for the Church of
     God at large. During the servic  at Lambeth, I entered      with some fixedness, into the sentiments expressed in the
     prayers; and intend to review them frequently, to bring my
     vows to remembrance. When having the robes put on me, the
     language of the Church in Isaiah came to my mind, and I
     prayed to be clothed with the garments of Salvation, and
     the robe of righteousness.

     ‚ÄúWhilst standing before the table in my rochet, I thought
     of Latimer, led to the stake in his long shirt; and, I
     trust, desired to be found faithful unto death.... On the      whole, I bless God for the grace vouchsafed to me this day,
     and only desire that the impression may remain; which past
     experience teaches me will not be the case, unless Thou,
     O Lord, carry on that, I trust, Thou hast began. ‚ÄòForsake
     not the work of Thine own hand,‚Äô for Jesus‚Äô sake, Amen and
     Amen.‚Äù

Soon after his consecration, Bishop Corrie remarks in a letter to his
wife, as he notes also  n a memorandum:--

     ‚ÄúI am not yet reconciled to my change of signature. The
     meaning of the change I understand to be, that those      who are appointed to rule in the church of Christ, take
     the name of that portion of His body (He being Head and
     Bridegroom of the Church) to which they are, in the
     language of Scripture, ‚Äòmarried.‚Äô If my new name do not
     remind me of allegiance, and tend in some degree, to bind
     me to obedience, it will not operate as it ought to do. I
     find, however, the same old nature still within me, and
     that it changeth not with a name. May a new nature, as well
     as a new name, be wrought in me!‚Äù

On the 18th of June, the Bishop had, by special appointment, a
private audience of the king. The account of this interview with King
William IV. was recorded at the time by Bishop Corrie, and is too
characteristic of that kind-hearted sovereign to be omitted:--

     ‚ÄúI went to St. James‚Äô at four o‚Äôclock,‚Äù observes the
     Bishop, ‚Äúand had an interview with the king alone. On      entering his closet, his Maj   y came forward, offered      his hand which, kneeling on one knee, I kissed. He then
     desired me to sit down; and detained me about half an hour.      Asked, Where I was educated? Where born? How long I had
     been in India? My income? Pension? How long I was going
     out for? My motives in going? Whether I had any relatives,
     &c. Saying, amongst other things, ‚Äòthat the Indian Bishops      ought to have a house: that he did not like the cutting
     down of salaries; feared it would bring back the old
     abuses; expressed a high opinion of the Indian servants
     of government, and much interest in the welfare of India;      wished me health and strength to perform my duties; told
     me not to remain in India, if my health failed; and said      he should be happy to hear of a Bishop‚Äôs appointment to
     Bombay. He then most graciously dismissed me.‚Äù

On Friday the 18th, the Bishop attended the Committee of the
Socie y for the Propagation of the Gospel. The Bishops of Lichfield
and Bangor were present; and at the request of the meeting, the
last-named prelate drew up a resolution congratulatory of Dr. C. on
his appointment to Madras, and expressive of the good wishes of the
socie y towards him; after which he took his leave.

The next day, the Bishop and his daughter went on board a steamer at
the Tower-stairs and joined the ‚ÄúExmouth,‚Äù which was then lying in
the Downs, and in which they had secured a passage to Madras. At four
o‚Äôclock that evening, the anchor was raised, and the ship got under
sail for her d   ination. During the following week, however, they
did not make much way, for on the 26th of June, the Bishop writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúThe wind has been contrary, as you will conclude from
     the date of this. It is still contrary, but hav    now      sea-room, the pilot is about to leave us. Farewell,
     then, to England, probably for ever; though I have no
     presentiment or resolve on that head. And farewell to
     beloved relatives. How happy are we in the prospect of
     dwelling together in the ‚Äòci y which hath foundations!‚Äô
     In this, surely, we who have lately met are favoured; and
     truly thankful am I for this communion with you.

           ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll praise God for all that is past,
            And trust Him for all that‚Äôs to come.‚Äù

There were on board the Exmouth, several passengers; among whom were
the Rev. M. Wilkinson and his family, returning to their missionary
labours in India. Besides passengers, were one hundred recruits,
with their officers, proceeding to join H. M. 16th regiment of
foot. On Sundays, as the weather permitted, the Bishop was in the
habit of celebrating divine service on deck, and of admitting daily
to family-prayer in his cabin, as many as chose to attend; whilst
Mr. Wilkinson collected from among the soldiers, a Bible-class of
sixteen, with whom he read the Scriptures every day. In the evening
of the 6th of September, the Exmouth reached the Cape of Good Hope,
where the Bishop had the comfort of finding his wife‚Äôs health greatly
recruited. As, also, the Chaplains at the Cape were in expectation
of Bishop Corrie‚Äôs return, they had prepared their young people for
Confirmation, and he accordingly administered that rite on the 12th
of September, to 150 candidates. On that day also, his youngest
daughter was married to Mr. George Bird, of the Madras civil service.
On the 13th, the Bishop with his wife and daughter sailed from
Simon‚Äôs bay, and reached Madras on the 24th of October. On the same
day, previously to landing, he recorded the following memorandum:--

     ‚ÄúAfter several days of very slow progress, we are now,
     through God‚Äôs goodness, in sight of Madras, but unable
     to go in, until the sea-breeze springs up. Uninterrupted
     mercies have followed me through the voyage home and
     hitherto. Much favour has been shewn to me by many of
     the excellent of the earth. Persons in authori y have
     manifested great civility. Supplies forthcoming in the most
     ready manner, and from unlooked-for sources. I trust some
     knowledge on various subjects has been acquired by me, and
     some increased attention to the holy Scriptures. New duties
     now await me, and the prospect often oppresses me, lest I      fail. Keep thy servant from presumptuous sins, and enable
     me to walk humbly with thee. Let no elation, on account of
     outward circumstances, find place in me; nor d pression
     on account of conscious inefficiency, prevail to hinder
     me from doing what I can! May I be enabled to order my      household in a becoming manner. Prepare my ways, O Lord,      with those in authori y; and enable me to act in all things
     as the servant of Jesus Christ!‚Äù

Bishop Corrie hav    landed at Madras on Saturday Oct. 24, was
installed at St. George‚Äôs Church, during the morning-service, on the
following Wednesday. Archdeacon Robinson officiated on the occasion.
For the first few weeks after his arrival in Madras, the Bishop
occupied himself almost exclusively in making himself acquainted with
the state of things around him. Thus on the 15th of December, he
writes


                           TO HIS BROTHER.

     ‚ÄúI have been taken up hitherto in exchanging visits of
     civility. I have preached, indeed, in all the churches,
     of which we have six in Madras, and one at the Mount, six
     miles distant. I have, also, visited some of the schools,
     and been making myself acquainted with the state of things
     here as to religion. It is low enough with respect to the
     descendants of Europeans. A district Visiti   Society is
     much on my mind, as a means of getting at individuals, in a
     more direct way than has been attempted hitherto. I think
     I begin to see my way in this matter; but feel often much
     oppressed. We have several good men amongst the Chaplains;
     but I am not yet familiarly acquainted with them, and our
     communications are consequently somewhat stiff.

     ‚ÄúMadras is not at all like Calcutta; we live in houses
     surrounded by large gardens. Ours stands in between two or
     three acres, and is quite private, though in the centre of
     the place, and about three miles from the landing-place.
     The surf which breaks on the shore all along the coast, is
     constantly sounding, and at first attracted our notice; but
     it is now become a common thing.

     ‚ÄúThe Missions in the south are in much confusion, in
     Tanjore, from the caste question; in Tinnevelly from
     Rhenius‚Äôs separation. I am requested to visit them next
     month.‚Äù

The question of caste here alluded to, was in truth none other in
principle than that which troubled the Church in the first ages,
(Gal. ii. 3, &c.) and in like manner had created divisions and
heart-burnings among the native Christians at Tanjore. Scarcely had
Bishop Corrie arrived in Madras, before he received a long petition
from some of the native priests, native catechists, schoolmasters
and other native Christians in Tanjore and its vicinity, requesting,
among other things, that the injunctions left by the Bishop of
Calcutta respecting the total abolition of caste, might be somewhat
relaxed. It was with reference to that circumstance, that the Bishop
addressed the following letter to the senior native catechist at
Tanjore:--

                                          ‚ÄúMadras, Dec. 29, 1835.

     ‚ÄúI lately received a letter in the Tamul language, which
     has been translated for me, and purports to be from several
     Christians, inhabitants of the villages over which you      were formerly Catechist. They express great regret on
     account of your removal, and complain of those who are at
     present placed by the Rev. Missionaries to instruct them.
     It is my purpose, ‚Äúif the Lord will,‚Äù to visit Tanjore
     about the middle of January, when I will endeavour to
     ascertain what is the true character of the Catechists
     complained of, and will take such measures respecting them
     as the case may require. In the mean time, you will be so
     good as to make known this my purpose to the parties who
     wrote the letter. I wish at the same time, to beg of you,      who have so long been a teacher of the mercy of God to
     others, to consider anew the question of caste. Can you      hold it as a Christian principle that God is a respecter
     of persons, and that those who are high-born, can, on that
     account, claim to come first to the table of the Lord?      No man of any caste, who is an unbeliever, or an immoral
     person, or profane breaker of any of the commandments of
     God, ought to be permitted to come at all to the Lord‚Äôs
     Supper; and I am certain that due respect will always be
     shewn to respectable Christians, by true Christians who
     may be inferior to them in temporal circumstances. But
     you will not, I think, wish to maintain that any one can
     claim precedence in spiritual things, merely on account
     of natural birth or any outward distinction. I need not
     quote to you the scriptures, that in the Lord Jesus, ‚Äúthere
     is neither circumcision, nor uncircumcision, Barbarian,
     Scythian, bond nor free;‚Äù but ‚Äúas many as received Him, to
     them gives he power to become the sons of God.‚Äù

     ‚ÄúI pray God that you and others, who are leaders in
     the Lord‚Äôs army, may candidly consider this point in a
     purely Christian view, and without reference to any past
     proceedings. I desire to come among you as a peace-maker,      and restore harmony among you if I can. I greatly lament
     the distress which many, I hear, are suffering; and if
     you, who are leaders, will meet me in the spirit of
     Christian love, some of the distress may be removed. Not
     only, therefore, in regard to the purity of the Christian
     doctrine, but from love, also, to your countrymen and
     fellow-christians, I hope you will be for peace.‚Äù

The separation of Mr. Rhenius at Tinnevelly, from the Church
mission at that place, had occurred before Bishop Corrie reached
Madras. It appears that early in 1835, Mr. Rhenius had most
unjustifiably published a tract for the purpose of impugning the
government, ritual, and discipline, of the Church of England,
notwithstanding that he stood connected as a missionary with the
Church Missionary Society. However painful it might therefore be,
to that Society, to dissolve their connection with a person who had
for twenty years zealously laboured as a missionary, yet, under
the circumstances of the case, they felt bound in consistency, as
conscientious members of the Church of England, to declare that the
relationship which had hitherto subsisted between Mr. Rhenius and
the Society was at an end. In this decision Mr. Rhenius readily
acquiesced, and quitted Tinnevelly in June 1835, having previously
delivered over all the concerns of the Church-mission there, to the
Society‚Äôs representative. Within a few months, however, Mr. Rhenius
thought proper to return to Tinnevelly, at the invitation of some
dissatisfied catechists; and the natural consequence was, that the
whole mission at that place underwent a change from a state of
organization and peace, to a scene of strife and disorder. It was
with the hope that some remedy might be suggested for this lamentable
state of things, that the Bishop thought it of importance that he
should ascertain personally what might be done for peace and order.

     ‚ÄúI go,‚Äù he observes, in a Letter to his brother, ‚Äúat much
     personal and pecuniary inconvenience. It will cost me ¬£100;
     but my instructions are called for, and I cannot direct in
     the dark. I go with much fear and distrust of myself; but
     by calm investigation, and taking no hasty steps, I trust I
     may effect some good.‚Äù

In a memorandum which the Bishop made January 2, 1836, in the
prospect of the journey, he states:--

     ‚ÄúI have examined the Madras Asylum, both male and female;      and the high school at Vepery. Examined also, the native
     girls‚Äô school of the Church Missionary Society. In all of
     them a very considerable knowledge of Scripture is found. I
     have received Mr. Hickey, as a Missionary to the Portuguese
     congregation of the Vepery Mission; and am endeavouring to
     bring about a district Visiting Society for Black Town, and
     to have the Church-building fund confined to this Diocese;      which seems agreeable to all I have met with, who wish well
     to the object. I have taken steps towards issuing marriage
     licences. In all this, there is all the prosperity I could
     desire: yet never at one period have my trials been so
     great. The experience of that Pope, who is said to have
     doubted of his salvation, more and more, as he advanced in
     the Orders of his Church, till having gained the highest
     step, he utterly despaired, sickened and died, has been
     much on my mind.... Frequently I awake in the night with a
     feeling of dismay inexpressible, as to what may be the end
     of myself, and in respect of the objects contemplated by
     my office. Intending to visit Tanjore and Tinnevelly, I am      at a loss utterly how to proceed, or what to attempt. I am      indeed oppressed: O Lord, undertake for me. I will still
     thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!‚Äù

It was on the 11th of January 1836, that Bishop Corrie left Madras on
his mission of peace. The incidents connected with this journey are
related in the following correspondence with his wife and family, or
in occasional memoranda:--

     ‚ÄúSadras, Jan. 12, 1836. I arrived here at 4 o‚Äôclock this
     morning, just 11 hours after the Palkee left home, and this
     included the passag         river after I left you, and
     the delay at the first stag     nearly half an hour. The
     bearers therefore, travel faster here than in our country:
     they do not change shoulders so often, but go generally a
     swinging step, which is very uneasy. T   road lay all the      way within sound of the surf, and here the Bungalow is not
     above a gun-shot from the sea. There is one old fort, and
     many descendants of Dutch, all very poor; the Bungalow      is in very nice order, and has accommodation for three
     parties. A Colonel, his wife, and some children, with an
     Ayah,[172] came in about 7; they have two rooms, and I
     one, but we see nothing of each other. Notwithstanding the
     nois         bearers, and the jolting of the Palkee, I
     slept a good deal, and had a nap after arriving, although a
     disturbed one. Fish and eggs were provided for breakfast,      and I am as comfortable as I can be from home; but I feel
     much a stranger and very lonely. My thoughts are often with
     you all, and heavy thoughts also arise as to t   result of
     my journey. The more the state of the Tanjore people is
     enquired into, the more difficult it appears to deal with
     them. Their teachers have countenanced much that is wrong      among them, by administering among them, without reproving      their errors; from which they at length have concluded
     themselves blameless; and in looking over the list of
     charges urged against them, many seem matters of choice,      which we all observe or not according to taste. May He in      whom alone is wisdom and strength, give me both to perceive      and to know what things I ought to stipulate for, and grace
     faithfully to fulfil the same; and may He ‚Äòturn the hearts
     of the disobedient‚Äô among them, ‚Äòto the wisdom of the
     just!‚Äô‚Äù

     ‚ÄúMyaveram, Jan. 14. I arrived here at half past six, and
     having changed my clothes and reposed a little, purpose
     giving you a brief sketch of my journey thus far. I am in
     the hous     Sir Henry Montgomery, the deputy Collector
     of Tanjore, but have not yet seen him or his lady. T        whole way I have come is, as to country, not only without      interest but very dreary; partly I suppose, that being      along shore, the sea air is unfavourable to vegetation.
     T   road was to Sadras firm and good, after that to
     Pondicherry, partly sandy, and partly lakes of water,      and partly on the very brink of the sea. Since leaving      Cuddalore, at first sandy and heavy, then stiff soil, but      no mad  road; and it took twelve hours to travel about
     thirty-six miles. We crossed four pretty broad rivers
     during last night; two of them branches of the Coleroon, a
     name renowned in Orme‚Äôs account of Hindoostan, and which I
     little expected ever to behold. On two of the rivers are
     ferry boats, provided by Government, good and substantial;
     but all the other boats I have been obliged to us  are
     both comparatively small and very fragile. The water has
     nowhere been deep, though enough to give a good ducking.
     T   Coleroon even might have been passed by wading, but      t   bearers professed fear of Alligators. The song of the
     bearers continues the same all the way as at Madras.

     ‚ÄúOne mod  of adorning their temples, is peculiar to t is
     part of India. Near a Hindoo Pagoda on this sid  Sadras,      I observed a colossal figure of a man seated on a throne.
     For a time I could not make out what it could be. Yesterday
     morning, the same kind of figure presented itself with
     a spearman on each sid  standing by it, and in front a
     hug  figure of a horse. Yesterday evening, passing near a
     shady grove there seemed to be a row o   igers guarding
     the entrance, which in the gloom        twilight appeared
     at first very formidable: and just before I reached my
     present position, a row o  elephants, and figures of men on
     horseback, seemed to guard the entrance to a temple; and
     behind were figures as of a flock of sheep. T is is all I
     have seen new on my way. T is place is like a garden in      not quite a wilderness, for the country seems fertile, but      irregularly cultivated; and a pretty lawn with a variety
     of flowers in front, gives a lovely appearance, to my
     eye, which has seen nothing like it since leaving Madras.
     I must not, however, disparage Cuddalore; but it is an
     old regularly formed town, with 300 European pensioners
     scattered about it, besid s the gentry, civil and military.
     I passed yesterday from half past 9 till half past 4,      gaining useful information on missionary matters. Contrary
     to my former experience on this point. I sleep a good deal
     during t   night, so as to require no sleep during t   day.

     ‚ÄúTwelve o‚Äôclock. At breakfast, met Sir Henry and his lady.
     T  y are nice young people, and both seem very happy      and intelligent. They have been here five years, quite
     sequestered: he has been eleven years in the service, but      looks considerably younger, with fine speaking eyes. T  y
     go home next year on furlough. T  y make me very welcome,      and I have a nice apartment, all in the bungalow style.
     Tanjore forty miles: I am to be driven part of the way      in the evening. T   christian Catechist, and some of his
     people have been to see me; about 600 young and old are      under christian instruction.

     ‚ÄúI am not yet half on my way; the distance looks at times
     dreary, and th   ld idea of dragging a lengthened chain,      applies a little to my case. May duty prevail as it ought,      and my chains will feel proportionably lighter! T ink of m       when on your knees!

     ‚ÄúTanjore, January 17. Intending to proceed at bedtime
     to Trichinopoly, I leave this for to-night‚Äôs post; as
     otherwis  several days would intervene before you hear
     of m  again--the distance to Trichinopoly is thirty-six
     miles. On Friday I had a busy day with the Missionaries,      ascertaining t   number and state of their congregations,      accounts of their proceedings &c. Yesterday I was occupied
     almost the whole day with the Nonconformists: at one
     time, and for about two hours, the room was quite full of      t  m. It was a time of great anxiety to me, hearing their
     objections, and answering them. The task was not difficult,
     but the point I stood upon was th  duty of attending the
     Lord‚Äôs Supper, without regard to who else might be present.      I stated that the bread represents our Lord‚Äôs body, and      t   wine his blood, which he offered on the cross for our
     redemption. In communicating, we are to t ink only of the
     Saviour, whose memorial is before us; and in receiving
     the bread and wine, we receive Christ as th  author of      our salvation. But if I refus  to receive the emblems
     of t   Saviour becaus  another has partaken before me, I      lose sight of t   Saviour, and treat the bread and wine as
     common food. T is t  y could not get over, and I am led
     to hope, most of them will yield this point, and if so,      I shall have to thank God for having come. If not I have
     done what I could in this matter. T rough God‚Äôs goodness      I am quite well to-day and preparing to preach in English
     at half-past ten; and to attend family service at four P.
     M.--Evening. T   congregation in the morning was about
     fifty, besid s many natives, who understand English. I
     have been addressing t   native congregation t rough Mr.
     Coombes: may a blessing follow from above!

     ‚ÄúJanuary 19th. I received yours        15th, yesterday,
     at Trichinopoly, and sat down to answer it, but was      interrupted. I wrote you from Tanjore most of the
     particulars of my visit there. There is nothing to see
     but the fruits o  Swartz‚Äôs labours in two Churches, and      t   many called by t   name of Christ among t   natives.
     Mr. Coombes is invaluable there from his knowledge of
     Tamil, and th  right spirit h  manifests. I arrived there      yesterday morning soon after six: every t ing was done for
     my comfort. I went before breakfast to t e Church, which      was near, and saw Heber‚Äôs grave, which will long render
     Trichinopoly a place of interest. 
     ‚ÄúTrichinopoly is a large station, with good roads about it.      Both at Tanjore, and th re, t   chief city is within the
     Fort, which at Trichinopoly encompasses a pyramidical hill,      on the top of which is a hous  of imposing appearance, a      kind of monastery of Brahmins. I write this at a staging
     bungalow, half way to Madura. I have here an invitation
     from Mr. Blackburn the Judge of Madura; and th  Cutwal has
     been ordered to shew m  all attention. On arriving I was      saluted with the rattling of tom-toms, and four or five      native hautboys and th  Tahsildar[173] came after breakfast
     to wait upon m  with like state. T   bungalow stands in a      valley surrounded by irregular hills, something like those
     at Chunar. T   climate is cool, and at night cold. T  
     caus  of so much coolness in this latitude, must ris  from      t   sea on the east, and the ghauts on the west. I am now
     forty miles from t   sea, having been verging inland ever      since leaving Cuddalore.

     ‚ÄúMadura, Wednesday morning. I arrived here at two this
     morning, and have had som  hours quiet sleep in a fine
     upper room. I have not yet seen Mr. Blackburn, but every      t ing around is in the most comfortable style of an Indian
     Judge. T   country all around is flat, with a continuation
     of irregular detached hills as yesterday. The night
     travelling quite unhinges my frame, as the hand-writing
     shews. I shall become more steady after a m al. T is place      is worth describing, but the post go s to Madras at eight,      so I have not time.

     ‚ÄúJan. 21. I am now t rough God‚Äôs goodness within sixty      miles of Palamcottah; another night‚Äôs run will, proceeding      as I have done, bring me to my journey‚Äôs end, outward
     bound. I yesterday sent off a letter for you from Madura.
     Th  collector, Mr. Blackburn, was as kind as possible. He      invited the other three civilians to tiffin. There were      two officers with a detachment, at som  distance, and four
     American missionari s whom I did not see. T   Judge has an      infant, whom I am to baptize on my way back, and th re are
     children of writers, &c., desirous of t   same. None of our
     Bishops came so far south; so that I am the first who has
     visited th se parts. Alas, how inadequate to meet public
     expectation!

     ‚ÄúMr. Blackburn‚Äôs hous  is one of t   best in the country.
     To t   south of it is a large sheet of water, and a small      island in the midst, with a truly picturesque temple upon      it. Madura is famous in Hindoo Mythology. A grand festival      is to be h ld on 1st February, when the idol will be
     brought from t   temple at som  distance, and take a sail      on the lake and visit the summer-hous  on the island.
     About a lac    people generally collect on the occasion. I
     have seen several temples, all in the style of Juggernauth
     for size.

     ‚ÄúAt Madura, as at Trichinopoly, t   temple is within the
     fort, and th  town is there. T   country all along very      interesting, and the population very scanty. In the rains,      t   face of t   country must be covered with water, it
     is so flat; and now t ere are little streams and rills
     constantly occurring. Th se are fed by t   water from      t   hills to t e westward, and for six years the supply      has been very scanty. This year the rain has fallen
     plentifully, and crops of all kind, but principally rice,
     are abundant. The people are beginning to gather in the
     rice. T  y are at work in a thres ing-place close to t e      staging bungalow. I feel very lonely to-day, though in much      peace--my mind has been much with you all during the night. 
     ‚ÄúPalamcottah, Friday.--At the end of my journey. I now
     begin to look back, and th  way seems not so long as did      t   distance I have come. I was going on as usual, and had
     fallen asleep when the Palkee was set down at two, and I      was told Mr. Tucker was come. He had kindly com  out about
     ten miles; we returned about two miles, when the whole
     body of catechists were standing on each side the way, and
     received us with a song o  prais . I got out and thanked      t  m for their congratulations, expressing my wish s for      t  ir prosperity. We then came on a tumultuous cavalcade,
     and reached the mission-hous  at twenty minutes past four.      Mr. Tucker prayed, and I went to rest for two hours. We
     breakfasted at eight, after family worship. After that,
     ten divisions of catechists and schoolmasters, came in
     rotation to make _salaam_. T  y marched in, singing a verse
     o  prais . Flowers were scattered on my head, and gold and
     silver stars; som  of which I mad  Joseph gather, when      all were gone, to bring to Anna. T   English residents
     have been to see m  also; you know t at bustle rather
     upsets than gratifi s me. My feelings have rather been
     blunted than pleased by all this; and a feeling of my own
     utter worthlessness before God keeps me low, as also of
     unprofitableness towards m n.

     ‚ÄúJanuary 25th. My purpose is to stay here over Sunday next,
     to be at Madura on Tuesday; Trichinopoly on Thursday; and
     at Tanjore, till the Sunday evening following. On the
     Monday, Mayaveram; Tuesday, at Porto Nova; Wednesday at
     Cuddalore. Perhaps stay there till Monday evening. Friday,
     at Sadras; and on Saturday, February 12th, at _Dul         Domum_. Such is my purpose: may God of his goodness dispose      accordingly!

     ‚ÄúYesterday we had morning service in English, and in the
     afternoon, in Tamil. I preached both times, the latter you      will judge, by an interpreter--the native congregation      about 500. Mr. Rhenius‚Äôs proceedings are of t   most
     injurious kind. He is either blinded by self-love, or most
     mis rably misinformed, which must be his own fault; but
     I have not time to-day for particulars. We are all going
     to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Prendergast; Mr. P. is also
     here. Till this mom nt I have been occupied with about 200
     catechists and school-masters.‚Äù

The following remarks on the state of t   Tinnevelly Mission, occur
among the Bishop‚Äôs private memoranda:--

                                     ‚ÄúPalamcottah, Jan. 28, 1836.

     ‚ÄúI have been here now seven days, and have been
     endeavouring to form a distinct idea of t   circumstances
     o  this Mission. It appears, that from t   first,
     expectations    redress of wrongs have been held out to      such natives as sought aid from t   Missionari s. Hen         a Vakeel[174] has been employed at th  charge of t  
     mission, to ascertain particulars of complaint, and to
     make representations accordingly to t e Tahsildars and in      t   cutchery[175] of t   collector. And this practice      has so increased, t at Mr. Pettitt is chiefly occupied      in hearing and arranging the temporal affairs of native
     applicants. T   consequen   has been t at whole villages,
     or the greater part of the inhabitants of som  villages,
     have ‚Äúcom  over,‚Äù as the expression is, at once, to put
     themselves under Christian instruction ostensibly, but at
     the same time, to enjoy t   protection referred to. Of      t   many thus reported, comparatively few have received
     baptism. In one village of 600, only forty are baptized. 
     ‚ÄúOn enquiring of t   assembled inspecting Catechists
     to-day, ‚ÄòHow it came to pass, that of so many reported
     under Christian instruction, for several years, so few were
     really baptized?‚Äô--the answer given was, ‚ÄòPartly from t  
     inattention or bad example of t   Catechists; partly, that
     many being disappointed in their expectations    worldly
     benefit, drew back to heathenism; or, having obtained their      object, became satisfi d, and were not desirous of baptism.‚Äô

     ‚ÄúIt appears t at littl  or no distinction is observed      in the treatment of t   baptized, and unbaptized. T  
     Catechist marri s the unbaptized when called upon, and also
     t   baptized. In both cases a charm is put on the neck
     o  the female, instead of a ring on t   finger. The same
     services are observed at th  burial of t   baptized and
     unbaptized; except that in t   former case, going to t e
     hous  of t   deceased, and more ceremony is observed. Som 
     do not use t   Church service over the unbaptized, but pray
     extempore. Mr. Rhenius in the early part of his Mission,
     used the service of t   Church of England in baptism; and
     confirmed som  you   persons by t   imposition of hands,
     as directed in our Confirmation-service; but afterwards
     omitted our forms altogether.

     ‚ÄúTh  children of converts seem not to have been attended      to, after the Scripture rule. Som  persons having families,
     were reported, by a Catechist, as baptized seven years
     ago. Their children, neither then, nor since baptized.      It seems t at Mr. Rhenius has sent to all his Catechists
     and School-masters to com  and pay their respects to t e
     Bishop; and accordingly a considerable number came after
     breakfast. On Mr. D nt having called, I explained that I      was the Inspector of t   Church of England‚Äôs Missions; and
     that they having left it, what had I to do with them? One
     very plausibly answered, ‚ÄòThat they worshipped the same      Lord, and held the same faith, and preached the same Gospel
     as before.‚Äô I asked if nothing was said in Scripture of      t   sin of schism? They answered, ‚ÄòY s.‚Äô I then said, ‚ÄòWas
     there no sin, t at when one man in a village beat t   drum
     to call t   people to prayers, another should beat th       same drum? When one began to pray, another should begin to
     pray?‚Äô They owned this was wrong; but attempted to lay the
     blame on the Church Missionary Society‚Äôs catechists: but I      observed from t   case of t   you   man who came before m        the other day, (a catechist of Mr. Rhenius‚Äô) that h  had
     owned that h  held public worship, at th  same time with      t   Church Missionary catechist. A long examination of
     persons followed, which, with information before received,
     led me to address t   party as follows:--‚ÄòThat for fifteen
     years past, t   word of God had been made known, and spread       abroad in thes  parts by means of t   Church Missionary
     Society. T at many had becom  enlightened with the light
     o  life. T at Mr. Rhenius had been supplied during that
     time, with funds as a Missionary of t   Church Missionary
     Society. T at having separated from t   Society, h  left      t   place; and that during his absen   all was peace in      t   mission. T at t   you   man present, who wrote t  
     letter, stating that t   congregations were wishing for      his return, admitted that h  did not of his own knowledge
     write t us, but that t   catechists, who signed the letter,
     told him so. T at som  of the Head-men whose names were
     affixed to the letter, told me, ‚Äòthat they knew not that
     it was a letter of recal, but [thought it] only a friendly
     letter of congratulation on his arrival at Arcot. That one
     of t   inspecting catechists (then present, and now in
     Mr. Rhenius‚Äô employment) had confessed having expressed to
     Mr. Tucker his sorrow for having signed the letter to Mr.
     Rhenius; and that h  did not know that it was an invitation
     to come back, having read only a part of it; and was not
     aware how bad a man David Pillay is:--That a head-man
     present, had confessed just now, t at if Mr. Pettit would
     have let him t   land, and the palmyra-trees at Dobnavoor,
     for t   money he wished (viz. four Rs. instead of ten Rs.)
     he would not have joined Mr. Rhenius:--That several other
     o  Mr. Rhenius‚Äô people present, had owned [to] having been,
     at different times, convicted of delinquen ies:--That Mr.
     Rhenius had been told of t   deceits practised upon him,
     but h  would not believe it of those who invited him back.
     Thes  things, in my presence, had been confessed by t  m:
     but h  had come back, and all t is division had followed.
     The Society would therefore never receive Mr. Rhenius
     again. T at, for myself, I could not but grieve to think,
     how, in this way, Satan had prevailed to hinder the success
     of t   gospel. T at now the heathen laughed, and said, ‚ÄòT e
     preachers of t   Gospel of Peace, are quarrelling amongst      t  mselv s.‚Äô That for those present, who by deceiving Mr.
     Rhenius, and bringing him back, had been the occasion
     of t is evil, I should pray t at God would give them      repentance, that they might seek t   pardon of this their
     great sin, and not finally perish among the unbelievers.‚Äù

The Bishop adds:--

     ‚ÄúIn one case of ninety-nine families, in two adjoining
     villages, only three families are baptized; and in some      congregations not an individual is baptized.‚Äù

Two days after th  date of t is memorandum, t   Bishop prepared to
leave Palamcottah. He writes


                             TO HIS WIFE.

                                                  ‚ÄúJan. 30, 1836.

     ‚ÄúMy _dawk_ is ordered for to-morrow evening, so that
     I begin to think of myself as on my way hom  again. I      know not well whether any good has been accomplished by
     my visit, except convincing the people that t   Church
     Missionary Society will not abandon the mission. T e agents
     of Mr. R. had circulated far and wide that such would be      the case. There is no end to the falsehoods propagated by
     his agents, and to which    gave indirect occasion.

     ‚ÄúI have seen nothi   of t   cou try arou d, but from just      a littl  evening‚Äôs drive; yet towards t   west it is said
     to be interesting as to scenery, being towards t   Ghauts.
     I am no hand at drawing, as you know, but this sketch will
     give you som  idea of t is station.‚Äù


                                      ‚ÄúFeb. 1, Stageing Bu  alow.

     ‚ÄúFifty-two miles on t   way to Madras, and in good health.
     Thanks be to God! The dreariness of t is place answers very
     well to my state of mind, and gives opportunity for looking
     back.... Mr. Peet and Mr. Bailey cam  over from Travancore.

     ‚ÄúAfter th  Bishop of Calcutta had been there and had
     plainly spoken out w at reforms were considered necessary
     for t   clergy, t   two Metrans collected a hasty synod
     of t  ir Church, and voted in a violent manner that they
     would have no reform, nor anything further to do with t  
     missionari s. In consequen e t   labors of twenty years
     seem come to nothi  . It is now, I believe, intended that      the missionari s shall teach and preach as opportunity
     offers. If any of t   clergy reform, of which they have now
     som  hope, their way will be plain; but it remains to be
     seen. It had become necessary for Mr. Tucker to go over to
     see t   Resident, and consult with him as to the protection
     it may be in  is power, or be right for him to afford, to
     those who may turn from t  ir errors to the truth. Mr. T.
     will not b  above a week or ten days after m  at Madras.

     ‚ÄúYesterday, I ordained John Devasagayam, pri st. Mr. Tucker
     preached, and Messrs. Blackman, Pettitt, Peet, and Bailey,
     with Mr. Tucker, joined in the imposition of hands. T e
     service was all new to me; I had to look out my places,
     which took my attention too much off from t   sentiments
     expressed in the service. It was, however, on t   whole a
     day of seriousness, and I hope of blessi  . John preached
     in t   evening in Tamil; his text was appropriate,
     Ephesians vi, 18, 19. I was told h  gave a sketch of his
     training under Dr. John, t   colleague of good Dr. Rottl r
     at Tranquebar; and related the circumstances of his
     conversion, desired t   congregation to pray for him, &c.

     ‚ÄúAfter social prayer with t   mission family and the      catechists, I cam  away at half-past-eight. I arrived h re,
     fifty-two miles, by nine t is morning. By t is you will
     judg  how well these bearers carry; they go three before      and three behind, and t  ir stages are generally about      twenty miles and sometimes t irty; which they accomplish
     without seeming at all distressed. To-morrow, d. v. I have
     som  children to baptize at Madura, and t  n onward in the
     evening towards Trichinopoly, from whence I purpose writing
     again.‚Äù


                               ‚ÄúVerully Malay, Feb. 3, 1836.[176]

     ‚ÄúI am to-day at a stageing Bu  alow in the Tondeman‚Äôs      cou try,--t   titl  of an independent prince who retains
     his paternal inheritance independent of t   Company, in
     nam , and he is wise enough to be quiet, collect  is own
     revenu , and live at peace with t   lion. Yesterday, I
     sent off a letter to your beloved mother from Madura, and
     which I hope is before me; but am not certain, as I have
     com  on pretty quick. I m ntioned, in going from hen e,      a beautiful lake with a very tasty summer-house, on an
     Island in the middl  of it,--in front of t   Collector‚Äôs      house at Madura. Yesterday was the annual Festival of      the Idol at Madura; a float, with a very splendid temple
     erected upon it, was prepared on t   lake. A gentleman
     present said it was like t   Chinese Temples erected
     in St. Jam s‚Äôs Park, when the allied Sovereigns were
     in England. The Idol was brought with great noise, and
     amidst a larg  concourse of people, from t   Temple in
     t   fort, above a mile distant, and placed on t   float,
     which was then drawn by ropes, from t   shore, twice rou d      the lake. After a rest, t   float was drawn towards t  
     Island, where t   Idol was to pass t   evening, and the      Temple and the entire bank of t   lake to be illuminated
     at night. Vast crowds were going towards Madura, as I
     cam  away, to see t   illumination; and all the Europeans
     were to b  at Mr. Blackburne‚Äôs to view th  sight. I felt      no inducement to stay. Colonel Maclean was there with t        Tondeman, as resident. Two American missionari s who were
     settled at Madura, cam  to breakfast, and staid till 11
     o‚Äôclock conversing on missionary subjects. T ey are very
     self-denying and persevering in t  ir labours: I was much      taken with t  m. Two others of t  ir party were gone to
     Ceylon for change, having lost their wives at Madura,
     within three months of t  ir landi  . I baptized a child
     of Mr. Hooper, t   Judg , and saw th  catechist of t        Propagation Society. There is a branch of the Tanjore      mission h re, which has been much neglected of late
     years,--t   Lord‚Äôs Supper has not b en administered during
     two years past. I saw Mr. Rosen, t   missionary of t at      Society in Tinnevelly. His sphere of labour is about 20      miles distant from Palamcottah. H  cam  hither to see me,      and brought me a statement of his mission. H  is a Dane by
     nation, and a good man, but is deaf and quite inadequate
     to b  alone.... The people of Tanjore are in a deplorable
     state of apathy, and want of spiritual life. I cam  away
     from Madura before 5 P. M., and reached my halting-stage
     by five t is morning, when the bearers being ready, I
     cam  on hither, and am only 20 miles from Trichinopoly. I
     expect to be there by nine t is evening, and to enjoy a
     comfortable bed at Mr. Blair‚Äôs, which I rather anticipate;
     for three disturbed nights add considerably to t   natural
     tremulousness of my fram .‚Äù


                                 ‚ÄúTrichinopoly, Thursday morning.

     ‚ÄúI arrived h re last night just at gun-fire. Mrs. Blair
     is, it seems, so much better as to have gone to the      neighbourhood for change of air, and Mr. B. is with her;
     but everything was ready for m  here, and I was glad to go
     at once to bed. This morning early, I was roused by the
     sweet sou d of ‚Äòfairy-like music:‚Äô though, to b  sure,      the great drum rather dissipated t   idea of fairies. T e      European barrack is, I find, near; but the most joyous
     event, is a letter this morning from Mr. Bainbridg , saying
     you are all well.‚Äù


                             TO HIS WIFE.

                                          ‚ÄúTanjore, Feb. 6, 1836.

     ‚ÄúYou will know, I passed the whole of Thursday and
     yesterday, at Mr. Blair‚Äôs at Trichinopoly; he seems a very
     valuable man. There are fifteen families or so, who meet
     together on Tuesday evenings for religious improvement;      and among t   soldiers there is a Wesleyan, and a Church      of England Society. In t   latter, there are several of      the officers of H. M. Regim nt, who meet the men, and
     read prayers and a sermon. Finding t  re were so many
     pious people at the Station, I told the Chaplain we would
     have service last night. Accordingly, at a quarter past      6, we assembled in the church: t  re were not so few as
     100 soldiers, and the church appeared filled, though      not crowded, with officers and their families. My text      was Psalm cxxx. 4. A chair was placed for m  by the
     Communion-table, upon Heber‚Äôs grave. I was tired in body,      and could feel nothing on any subject; but it was a very
     solemn occasion to me, t at he, one of t   flowers of human
     nature, should have been cut down so seemingly prematurely,      and I, a withered stalk, left and put into his place.      Surely God‚Äôs ways are not as man‚Äôs ways! From Heber all
     good of which man is capable, might have been expected,
     whilst I can only say, ‚Äòmy desire is to t   remembrance of      Thy nam .‚Äô--H  perfects strength in human weakness, and
     by things foolish in t   eye of carnal reason, humbles      man‚Äôs pride, and causes it to b  acknowledg d t at t        ‚Äòexcellency of t e power is of Himself.‚Äô This is my only,
     but--blessed be God!--my sufficient consolation in my
     office. May God make manifest his strength in my weakness!

     ‚ÄúDid I tell you I went one evening to t   Fort at      Palamcottah, and had service with t   few artillerymen?      They seemed most attentive, and som  of t  m much moved;      and last Su day som  of t  m cam  to Church, though not
     ordered, and knelt in prayer, and appeared very attentive.
     Who knows but the arrow, shot at a venture, may fix a
     saving conviction in t  m? May it prove so!‚Äù


                                       ‚ÄúTanjore, Feby. 7th, 1836.

     ‚ÄúI have had a very fatiguing morning. At half-past seven      we went to Tamil service; after morning prayer I preached      on t   latter part of 1 Cor. xi. Mr. Coombes interpreting
     for me. After service t   Lord‚Äôs Supper was administered
     to upwards of 200 Native christians. Among t  m were three      of the hitherto nonconformists, the most intelligent of      the whole christian community; Pakianaden the native
     judg , Warswasyanaden, the native priest; and Thomas,      head catec ist. What effect their conformity will have      on t   rest, remains to be seen; but my object in coming
     hither at t is tim  seems gained. Thanks to God! There
     is a disposition, I fear, to require personal apologies
     from t  m: if t is is done, more inconvenience will
     arise; and surely w  should be content, if t   _principle_      of caste b  yielded by them. T e service was not over
     till after eleven. I feel t at if I were to attend the      afternoon-service, and preach as intended, I should
     probably have fever; and, with t   journey before me, I
     remain at hom  all the afternoon.

     ‚ÄúMo day. T e cou try generally is uninteresting and thinly
     peopled, but all last night w  seemed passing t rough a
     town: t   fertility of t   Tanjore cou try is proverbial.      Soon after day, we arrived at a village where all was
     bustle and activity: it is their Idol festival. A car very
     much decorated, and much more in t   style of a triumphal      car than any they have in the north, was being dragg d      through t   street, with frequent discharges of heavy
     pieces, or fireworks. The bearers took m  down a lane
     to avoid the crowd, or perhaps t at my _feringee_[177]
     presence might not offend the god. I am staying over the
     day on t   border of t   Tanjore cou try. In t   evening      cross the Coleroon, and shall reach Porto Novo by nine      or ten. Last night I slept very little--my thoughts were
     much with you. Sir H. Montgom ry has sent a peon[178] to      attend me through each of t   three stages under him: t is
     civility saves me trouble, and secures what I may want.

     ‚ÄúTuesday. Porto Novo. This is a very interesting place,      close on t   sea. I proce d to Cuddalore this evening and
     from t  nce, to-morrow, go to Sadras. I shall not probably      write again, as I shall be as soon at Madras as the post.‚Äù

The Bishop reached Madras on t   12th of February, but not without having suffered from t   fatigue inseparable from so long a journey.
H  considered himself, however, to have been amply compensated for
all the expence and exhaustion which he had encountered, since, if no other good should result, his visit to Palamcottah and Tanjore had
brought to light t   real state of t   missions there. With referenc  therefore to t at subject, he writes


                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                          ‚ÄúMadras, Feb. 17, 1836.

     ‚ÄúWe have many hundred Native christians here, and in t  
     provinces to t   southward, many thousands; but they are
     in a most deplorably low state as to true religion.... In      Tanjore, of nearly 5,000 profess d christians, scarcely      one is known to be spiritually-minded; and in Tinnevelly,
     of t e 10,000 reported christians, very few inde d are
     really convert d to God. Of t  m all, not above 2,000 men,      women and children included, are baptized, though all are
     treated as christians. T   old missions in t at quarter
     are also in a low state; and in t   most southern point      3,000 descendants of the first converts have return d to      heat  nism, and are mor  opposed to attempts at their      conversion than those who never heard of Christ....
     Afflicting as is the state of t  se people, there is no      room for discouragement. We must endeavour to do t  m good      with more simplicity and diligence. I have heard here of      a very characteristic remark of Bishop Turner. When asked      what he t ought of t   Tanjore christians? H  answered,      That he t ought the best way of dealing with t  m would be,
     to excommunicate t  m all, and begin t   work of conversion
     anew.‚Äù

The causes which mainly contributed to t is state of t ings seem to have been, t   worldly advantages and protection connected with the profession of christianity in Southern India, and the want of a sufficient number of competent missiona    . Worldly advantages have always been found to call forth t   duplicity of t   native
character, and to lead t  m for unworthy ends to place t  mselves
under christian instruction.[179] In t is case the number of
self-seekers seems to have been so great, t at, with every desire to do so, it becam  utterly impracticable for a few missiona     to give adequate attention to every individual native who might offer
himself for instruction. T e employment of, and trusting to, native
catechists becam  thus unavoidable, to a much greater extent than
under different circumstances could have happened. T  n, as these in their turn betray d th  confidence placed in t  m, by practising as
much deception as the pretended catechumens could do; and as those
who visited these localit    on behalf of t   missionary societ   ,
could in most cases hold intercourse with t   natives t  mselves,
only through an interpreter, t   inspectors of t   mission were
t   mor  easily misled by outward appearances, and interested representations. It were doubtless no difficult matter to sugg st, t at if a greater degree of caution had been us d in t   first
instance, on t   part of t   missionaries, som  of t   evils which the Bishop found in operation might have been prevented; but it is to b  feared t at t   blam  must ultimately rest on t at lukewarmness
in christians, which has never yet supplied missiona     in numbers
at all commensurate with t   magnitude of t   work to be done; nor
funds adequate to t   efficient support of t   few missiona     who have gone forth.

On t   return of t e Bishop from Tanjore and Tinnevelly, he took
measures for securing t at certain subscriptions collected in
Madras, toward the building of churches, and which had hitherto b en transmitted to Calcutta, to t   ‚Äúfund for all India,‚Äù should henceforth be vested in Trustees, and be applied, under th  direction
of diocesan and local committees, exclusively to the wants of the
presidency of Madras. T e Bishop, also, in addit on to his other
occupations, preached every Wednesday afternoon during Lent at t  
church in t   Fort, and on Friday evenings at the Cathedral. In a
letter which relates these circumstances, t e Bishop also observes 

                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                                  ‚ÄúApril 5, 1836.

     ‚ÄúA movement has lately taken place among t   East Indian      community which indicates improvement. Arrangements are      being attempted for establis ing an Indian Missionary
     Society. One rule is to be, that no missionary engaged      by t  m shall receive above eighty R . a month, and as
     much less as may be. T is, originating with t  mselves,
     looks well, but not ing is yet settled, nor any formal
     announcement of t   Society.‚Äù

The provisional Committee, however, of t is projected Indian Missionary Society, soon afterwards issu d an outline of t  ir plan
of operations, which was of t   so-call d liberal dissenting caste.

As the story of t   persecutions and sufferings of t   Irish clergy,
had by t is tim  reached India, it is scarcely necessary to say that
Bishop Cor    sympathised   eply with t ose his brethren, in t  ir
afflictions. Thus he writes 

                            TO MR. SHERER.

                                           ‚ÄúMadras, July 4, 1836.

     ‚ÄúI was requested by som  friends to call a meet ng[180] to      consider on means for relieving t e Irish Clergy. A failure
     was predicted, but ¬£300 were subscrib d in t   room, and
     sent to t   Archbishop of Armagh, by the last ship: ¬£400
     mor  have been since received by our treasurer; and by the
     end of t   month w  expect to receive in all 10,000 Rs.‚Äù

The Bishop then goes on to state, that

     ‚ÄúW at se ms of most importance to t is place, is the
     establis ment of a Grammar school. About four years ago I
     wrote, or aut orised Mr. M. to write, for a master for t  
     Calcutta High School. Mr. M. and I, when I was at home,
     talked over t   subject of a master, and h  renewed his
     enqui    , and found one. Amidst my many new avocations,
     th  subject had quite escaped me, till I received an      official notice from t   High School Committee, that t  y
     did not require a master, and should not receive t   one
     engaged, nor honour Mr. M‚Äôs draft for his passage. At first
     I was in trouble, but friends here viewed this refusal
     as providential for Madras. T e Bishop of Calcutta sent
     me 1000 Rs. to pay the passage-money, on t   young man‚Äôs
     ar  val in t   Juliana. He agreed to remain here, and we
     fulfilled all his expectations from Calcutta. On t   1st
     inst. t   school commenced, near Mr. Tucker‚Äôs Chapel, with
     thirty-three pupils, and the prospect of not fewer t an
     100. But sala     of all grades are lower here t an in
     Calcutta; and instead of eight R . for each boy, as there,
     we can only charg  four Rs. So t at w  shall have more to      struggle with here. But the work is, I trust, indeed of
     God, and will prosper. T e new Roman Catholic Bishop and      his Chaplain, had opened a school near where ours is, and      had about forty boys, most of t em sons of Protestants, who
     will now come to us again.‚Äù

The school here referred to, is that now called by the Bishop‚Äôs name,
and was in fact, t   resuscitation of a school known as the ‚ÄúParental
Academy,‚Äù but which had b en closed for nearly two years, in
consequence of t e inability of t   managing Committee to meet with
a suitable master. On its being merged in t   Madras Grammar School,
the former laws of t   Academy were remodelled, and a general outline
of a course of instruction prescrib d; the whole being accomplis ed mainly at t   suggestion or by the assistance of t   Bishop. 
It was also about t is tim  that t   attention of Bishop Cor   , was
mor  particula ly occupied by a   sire to aid in abating t e hardship
which Government imposed on t   christian servants of t   Company,
bot  civil and military, by obliging t  m to attend at the religious festivals of heathen and Mahommedans; and, in som  instances,
by calling upon t  m to present offerings, and to do homag  to senseless and impure idol . Many had b en th  representations, to the aut orit    in England, of t e sinfulness connected with t is
direct encouragement of idolatry, and the violence which was thus
done to t   consciences and feelings of t   public servants of
the Government; not to mention t e inconsistency of a compulsory
attendance on an unchristian ceremonial, with t at toleration which
Government professed to afford to all t  ir subjects in t   East.
Wearied out, as it would appear, by the importunity of t   agg   ved parties, th  Court of Directors, in a  ispatch to t   Indian Governments early in 1833, ordered, among other t ings 
     ‚ÄúThat t   interference of Brit sh functiona     in t  
     interior management of native temples; in t   customs,
     habit , and religious proceedings of t  ir priests and
     attendants; in t   arrangement of t  ir ceremonies, rites,
     and festivals; and generally, in t   conduct of t  ir
     interior economy, shall cease.

     ‚ÄúT at in all matters relating to t  ir temples, t  ir
     worship, t  ir festivals, t  ir religious practic  , and
     th ir ceremonial observanc  , our native subjects be
     entirely left to t  mselves.‚Äù

It might have been thought t at a  ispatch so plain, and direct in prohibiting any further outrages on t   consciences of christians,
would have met with t   ready attention of t   local Governments
in India; but as regarded Madras, it does not appear t at a single
step was taken to carry this posit v  order into effect. After
submitting, t  refore, for three years more to t is unaccountable
clinging of Government to Mahommedanism and idolatry, it was resolved
by a numerous body of t e clergy, civilians, and military, under t  
presidency of Madras, to address t   local Government. Accordingly,
a Memorial was drawn up, in which th  evils complained of were
enumerated, and the recital of t em cor oborated by documentary
evidence; and which concluded by respectfully but earnestly praying,
that t   instructions of t   Court of Directors might be practically
and universally enforced. T is document Bishop Cor    was requested to forward to Government, but in t   first instance, he had thought
it better, as a matter of courtesy and good judgment, to submit a
copy of it to t   Governor, in his private capacity; and in doing so,
the Bishop pointed out to Sir F. Adam, in what respects the relief
prayed for might, as he t ought, be readily conceded. T e Governor
was at t   tim  residing on the Nilgherries, but the Bishop‚Äôs
courtesy was entirely thrown away, for no notice of any kind was
taken of his communication. In t   month of July, t  refore, t  
Memorial was made public, and signed by about 200 of our countrymen
of all ranks; and on t   6th of August, the Bishop forwarded the
document to t   Governor of Madras in Council, accompanied by the
following letter:-- 
     ‚ÄúI have t e honour to transmit to your Excellency in
     Council, at t   request of t ose who have signed it, a
     Memorial, together with t   original signatures to it,
     enumerating instances w  rein those whose duty it is to      engag  in t  m, feel t  mselves agg   ved by practic  
     and orders which se m to t em contrary to t   command of
     God; thereby subjecting t  m to t   painful alternative of
     violating t e dictates of t  ir consciences, or incur  ng
     th   ispleasure of t   Government; and praying, that t  
     sam  toleration and exemptions, which have been long
     granted to t  ir Mahommedan and heathen fellow subjects,
     may be extended to t   Christian members of t is Presidency. 
     ‚ÄúIt is my duty to state, t at I fully concur in  very part
     of t   Memorial, and its prayer: and I earnestly hope, t at
     it may be thought fitting to concede t   full measure of
     relief prayed for; and in respect to such part as rest 
     alone with t   Government of India to grant, t at your
     Excellency in Council will b  pleased to transmit th 
     Memorial to t   Right Honorable t   Governor General in
     Council, with your powerful recommendation in its favour.‚Äù

For a length of tim  this Memorial, like t e Bishop‚Äôs former
communication, was not honoured by any reply. Certain rumours,
however, were afloat, to th  effect, t at angry feelings had been
stirred up in t   mind of t   Governor in Council. And this proved to be t e case: for (that t   whole history of t is transaction
may be brought together) it may be stated, that early in October,
the Bishop received a letter from th  Chief Secretary to t   Government, reproac ing him in very unbecoming terms, for not
‚Äúusing his influence to allay t   zeal of overheated minds;‚Äù and
informing him t at both t   Memorial and a copy of t at letter had
been forwarded to t   Governor-general. A communication like t is
could have no other effect throughout India, t an to produce in all who knew t   parties concerned, and retained t   feelings of
gentlemen, a blush of sham  for the Governor in Council, and the
government Secretary. As regarded t   insulted prelate, it had long
been a settled conviction in his mind, that to be truly civilized a
man must be truly a christian; his natural  isposit on, t  refore,
 isposed him to pass over t is uncalled-for rudeness, as being but a
common-place manifestation of t at want of delicacy and refinement
which characterises every modification of heathenism. But, holding
as he did an official station in t   country, it se med to him t at
silence under such circumstances might be a compromise of t   respect
due to his office; and t  refore, as soon as the Bishop learnt t at
a copy of t is letter to him had been sent to Calcutta, he addressed th  following 

                 TO THE RIGHT HON. THE LORD AUCKLAND. 
     ‚ÄúOn my return to t is Presidency a few days since, I first
     learnt t at t   Right Hon. t   Governor of Madras in
     Council, had, together with a Memorial on t   subject of
     religious toleration, thought good to send to your Lordship
     in Council, a copy of a letter dated October 11, addressed      to me, and which I had concluded was intended only for
     th  information of t e Memorialist . In t at letter t  
     Governor has been pleased to admonish me as to t   duty
     my office imposed upon me, with ref rence to t   said      Memorial. T e aut ority of Government to dictate to me as
     to t   performance of my duties, I entirely deny. I hold
     myself free to act on my own judgment, as to what is my
     duty; and differing entirely as I do from th  Right Hon.
     th  Governor of Madras in Council, both as to t   prop   ty
     of granting t e toleration prayed for by the Memorialist ,
     and as to t   consequence of def rring to grant t   relief
     sought, I consider myself to have strictly been within t  
     line of my duty in forwarding t e Memorial to Government. 
     ‚ÄúOn this point, however, I need not have troubled your
     Lordship. 
     ‚ÄúMy object is to call attention to t   fact, that t  
     Memorial, which I am told I should have used my influence      to suppress, was prepared and in circulation for approval
     or correction, at several of t   p  ncipal stations of t is
     Presidency, when I arrived at Madras, in t   latter end
     of October, 1835. Copies had been p  nted for more ready
     circulation, as I afterwards learnt; and in March last,
     one of those copies was put into my hand . Observing t at
     officers were employed on services in which I have never
     known Europeans to be employed in t   Bengal Presidency, I      took t   liberty to forward p  vately, early in Ap  l last,
     t   copy of t e Memorial sent me, to t   Right Hon. t  
     Governor of Madras, t  n at t   Neilgherries, concluding
     that he had t   power to grant relief to t   military;
     and would, when he knew t   pain t   performance of those
     duties inflicted, be disposed to take measures to remove      the occasion of complaint. Of this communication no notice      was taken.[181] 
     ‚ÄúI observe t at som  of t   Calcutta newspapers accuse t  
     Memorialist  of asking for more toleration t an they are      willing to grant to others; and similar opinions may be
     held in other quarter . I t  refore take t   liberty, in
     t   nam  of all the clerical subscribers to t   Memorial,
     expressly to deny t is; and I am persuaded t at I speak
     th  sentiments of t   lay subscribers also on this point.
     If t   firing a salute on Christmas day be considered a
     claiming from th  natives a concession in favour of our
     religion, let t   salute be discontinued; and if t  re
     be any other c remony of our religion, on which natives
     ar  required to attend (though I know not of any) let
     compulsory attendance b  forbidden. 
     ‚ÄúIf t e Memorialist  have expressed t  mselves strongly
     respecting t e object of som  of t   c remonies in which
     th y ar  liable to be called upon to take part, they
     express only their own repugnance to be associated in such
     ceremonies, without t   slightest wish to impose restraint
     upon th  natives, or to interrupt t  m in t   smallest
     degree in t  ir own observances. T at Protestants may be
     exempted from taking part in proceedings, which imply t  
     violation of t  ir own peculiar p  nciples, is the only
     desire of t e Memorialist . 
     ‚ÄúIn t   hope t at t   information now conveyed may reach
     your Lordship before th  subject of t e Memorial is decided
     upon in Council, I have th  honour &c.‚Äù 
T is letter was dispatched to Calcutta toward the end of November,
and was courteously acknowledged by Lord Auckland; but before th 
official reply to t e Memorial was made public in Madras, and in
which t   conduct of t at Government to t   Bishop was faintly
reprehended, t   Bishop was beyond t   reach of further insult. 
On Friday, Aug. 26, 1836, Bishop Corrie held his primary Visitation
in t   Cath dral at Madras. T e sermon on th  occasion was preached
by the Bishop‚Äôs examining Chaplain, th  Rev. J. Tucker, Fellow of
Corpus Christi College, Ox   d. T e Charge, after som  preliminary
notices of what had been effected by those prelates who had
previously held Visitations in Madras, proceeded to touch upon th 
subject of caste among t e professedly Christian natives. On this
point t   Bishop stated it to be his decided opinion, that t ose who
were engaged in missionary labours should require from all natives
desirous of baptism, an explicit avowal, that t  y regarded all
for whom Christ died as spiritually equal in Christ. T e Bishop
adverted also to th  subject of education, and spoke of t   necessity
of uniting religious instruction with intellectual improvement. H 
strongly recommended catechetical instruction, as a means of great
usefulness. As important auxiliaries to ministerial labours, he
mentioned several Societies with approbation; and suggested with
regard to Visiting Societies, whether paid agency might not b 
beneficially employed. 
T e Bishop t  n alluded to the prospects of Christianity in India;
and whilst recognizing t e good feeling which prompted som  persons
to desire that christians of every denomination should unite to
spread t e gospel among t e heathen, he yet regarded such an union as
impracticable. H  noticed, moreover, th  subject of admitting persons
into Holy Orders, and expressed it to be his opinion that a competent
degree of learning should b  found among t e general body of t e
clergy. Although t  re might b  circumstances under which a Bishop in
India would have to be content with a lower standard of acquirements
in candidates for th  ministry, yet, it wa  his opinion, that at
the very least a Bishop ought to demand a fair English education, a
thorough knowledge of history, chronology, t e prophetical parts of
scripture, and of t   evidences by which t   Bible is proved to be the word of God; besides a full acquaintance with t   doctrines of
our Church, and a general knowledge of t   arguments by which its
polity may be vindicated. 
After referring to t   age at which t   Bishop wished young persons
to b  presented for Confirmation, and mentioning som  arrangements
and regulations he hoped to establish respecting t e celebration of
marriages, t   Bishop concluded his Charge by putting his Clergy in
mind of t   great importanc  of self-devotion to the work of t  ir
ministry. 
With reference to this meeting of his clergy, t   Bishop observes in
a memorandum, dated 
     ‚ÄúAug. 30, 1836. On Friday last I held my first Visitation.
     Preparing a Charge was a matter of much anxiety; especially
     as t   Bishop of Calcutta had entered so minutely, in
     his Charge of Dec. 1834, into all particulars connected
     with ministerial duty, and with t   circumstances of t is
     country. By God‚Äôs goodness I accomplished my purpose, and
     must leave th  result to God. In th  evening, t   Clergy
     dined with me, in number,  ncluding som  catechist ,
     twenty. I now desire to consider what may be t e proper
     objects of my journ y to t e out-stations. 1st. T e
     encouragement of t e pious, by preaching, conversation,
     and joining in religious exercises. 2nd. T e examination
     of schools, and confirming t e young, and exhorting t em,
     both before and after Confirmation. 3 d. By endeavouring
     to set right many points of litigation; and to establish,
     if possible, a good understanding between Chaplains and
     military Commanders. T ere is at present much irritation
     on t at point; and the Government is disposed to act very
     arbitrarily towards Chaplains. In all these attempt , may
     my sufficiency be of God, and His strength perfected in my
     great weakness!‚Äù 
T e day following t e date of t is memorandum, t   Bishop prepared
to leave Madras for th  purpose of visiting som  of t   out-stations.
T e places h  purposed to visit were Wallajabad, Arn e, Arcott,
Vellore, to Bangalore; t  nce to Bellary, Hyderabad, Masulipatam,
returning down th  coast to the presidency. T e following notices of
his visitation were drawn up, after his return to Madras:-- 
     ‚ÄúI left Madras, accompanied by the venerable Archdeacon
     Harper, on t e evening of August 31st. Our first visit was
     to Wallajabad. Every thing appeared well conducted in t is
     important Institution.[182] T e youths, eighty-seven in
     number, with t   other members of t   establishment, were
     assembled for Divine service, and the orderly behaviour,
     and cheerful appearanc  of t e boy , manifested that Mr.
     Hall, th  sub-conductor in charge, deserves t e good
     opinion which has been entertained of him. H  deserves also
     much credit on account of his attention to the religious
     instruction of t e boy . 
     ‚ÄúAll that seems wanting is a good school-master, with
     leisure to the boy  from t  ir respective drills for two
     hours each day, (which at present is not allowed) for
     receiving instruction in reading, writing, &c. with a sm   
     suitable library, which might b  supplied at very little
     expense. T e good to be effected by this institution has
     already begun to appear in t e young men already appointed
     to Corps. At Vellore w  found a set of t   Wallajabad
     youths attached to t   25th N. I. of whose general good
     conduct t   adjutant spoke in high terms. Another set was
     at Bangalore, who were also well spoken of, and from t  
     26th N. I. t   adjutant writes, s nce my return to Madras,
     ‚Äòth  sixteen drummers and fifers, all protestants, from t  
     dep√¥t at Wallajabad, are th  most promis ng youths of t  
     kind I hav  ever yet seen. 
     ‚ÄúAt Arn e there is no place of worship for th  soldiers
     to assemble in--a temporary place erected by subscription
     of t e officers and privates, had lately been blown down.
     A sm    building erected at t   expense of t e pious
     soldiers, and capable of holding only 150 or 200 persons,
     was used for th  services connected with t   Confirmation.
     T   Chaplain of Arcot attends alternate Sunday , t ere
     being no house at Arn e in which he can reside. He had
     been indefatigable and successful in preparing candidates
     for Confirmation, of whom seventy-one were confirmed;
     severa  being rejected as too young, and som  because of
     unestablished moral habits. Should a regiment be again
     stationed here, a suitable though temporary building should
     be erected for public worship. 
     ‚ÄúA Temperanc  Society of about sixty members exist  in H.
     M. 41st Regiment. 
     ‚ÄúAt Arcot, t   church is small, but in good order. T e
     interior arrangements are not well done, so t at much
     room is lost. T irty-two persons were confirmed, all East
     Indians,  ncluding a few from Vellore. H re th  care of
     t   Chaplain, as at Arn e, appeared in th  intelligence
     manifested by the young people of Arcot, beyond those of
     Vellore. At Vellore, t e whole christian community attended
     Divine Service on Tuesday, 6th September. T e place used
     for Divine service is part of an old palace, which requires
     being better fitted up. A school, containing seventy-two
     children, including a few natives, is supported by
     subscription, raised at t   station. At Vellore, is also a
     congregation of about 125 natives, including a few families
     of European pensioner , who are attended to by a native
     Catec ist of t   Society for th  Propagation of the Gospel,
     and assemble in a sm   , but neat chapel, belonging to that
     Society. 
     ‚ÄúA peon should be allowed here, to take care of t  
     burying-ground, which was in a neglected state. 
     ‚ÄúAt Bangalore, I remained from t   9th to t   20th
     September. During that time, I found that the schools
     and hospitals of t   different Corps, had been regularly
     visited by the Chaplains. A Temperanc  Society is in
     existence, containing nearly 200 members. A charity-school
     for boy , and another for girls, unconnected with t   army,
     each containing about twelve scholars, (who are boarded and
     clothed also,) are supported by voluntary contributions.
     A Friend-in-Need Society is also in operation, in which
     relief is provided for sick natives, and money weekly
     disbursed in sm    sums to the needy of t at class. T e
     Chaplains hav  th  superintendanc  of t ese institutions,
     assisted by a Committee of t e resident gentlemen. 
     ‚ÄúThe regular Sunday services are, one at seven, for one of
     H. M. regiments, and t e Artillery horse and foot with t  
     Christians connected with t   native troops. At eleven,
     a service in t e barrack of t e regiment, for those who
     may not hav  attended in t e morning at church--and one
     service at eleven in church, and at quarter past six in t e
     evening for th  station generally. T e attendance at t  se
     voluntary services is better than at any station in India.
     Ninety-eight persons were confirmed, and t ere were no less
     t an 104 communicants. 
     ‚ÄúFrom t   inconvenient structure of a barrack-room, as
     well as from t   associations connected with it, much of
     t   benefit of Divine service is lost to t   troops in t e
     barracks. I, therefore, at t   desire of severa  of t  
     residents, advocated t   erection of another[183] place
     of worship, in a situation more convenient also for th 
     Artillery and Dragoons; and received considerable support
     towards t   attainment of t at end. A place should also b 
     fitted up in th  Fort, where many Christians connected with
     t   arsena  and public offices reside, and w ere one of t  
     Chaplains should officiate one evening in th  week. 
     ‚ÄúA congregation of about forty native Christians
     assemble in t   church at nine on Sunday mornings, and
     are ministered to by a catec ist of t   Society for th 
     Propagation of the Gospel. 
     ‚ÄúI remained from 23rd Sep. to Oct. 3rd at Bellary. T is
     is a large and important field of labour for a clergyman,
     but t ere has been no Chaplain  ere for about three
     years past; and one consequence appeared in th  smaller
     number of candidates, compared with t   population, for
     Confirmation. Of t   fifty who were confirmed, about one
     half were unconnected with t   army. Beside t e regimental
     school, which is well conducted, a charity school of about
     forty children is supported by voluntary contributions
     at t   station, and a Society is in operation for th 
     relief of poor and sick natives. About 150 rupees a month
     are expended in this way. Of t   soldiers of H. M. 55th,
     I found a few in communion with t   missionaries of t  
     London Missionary Society at Bellary, and about fifteen
     or twenty in connection with t   Wesleyan Methodists.
     Sixty-four persons attended the communion on Sunday,
     October 2nd, of whom a considerable number were from t        private soldiers. 
     ‚ÄúSince my visit to Bellary, I learn t at an officer of
     t   Brigadier General‚Äôs Staff, reads prayers and a sermon
     in church on Sunday mornings, and that the attendance is
     considerable. T e church at this station needs enlarging;
     and contributions in aid of the Church-building Fund were
     set on foot to assist in meeting the necessary outlay. T        presence of a Chaplain is greatly desired by the residents,
     and Ghooty and Cuddapah in this district, should be visited
     by him. 
     ‚ÄúI remained at Hyderabad and stations dependent on it,
     from Oct. 8 to t   25th. Beside t e regimental school
     at Secunderabad, a station school is maintained by
     subscription, in which about forty boy , of whom seven
     are entirely maintained by t   charity, are educated in
     English, Teloogoo, and Hindoostanee--also a large class of
     Teloogoo boy , and a few Tamil boy . 
     ‚ÄúAt Bolaram, in a school, about fifty boy , Christians,
     Mahommedans, and Hindoos, are instructed in English, and
     nearly an equal number in Teloogoo; t   expences of which
     are supplied partly by subscription, but chiefly by t e
     Nizam‚Äôs Government. An English school of about twenty boy 
     is maintained at t   Residency. T e Scriptures, in t eir
     respective languages, are read in all t   classes. 
     ‚ÄúTher  are two services in church at Secunderabad on
     Sundays. T e church here, as at Bellary, is far too small
     for t e European congregation. A subscription in aid of the
     Church-building Fund was commenced here. A congregation of
     native Christians also assemble in t   church on Sundays at
     9 A. M.: a native Catec ist reads prayers, and a prepared
     sermon, in Tamil. T is congregation consists of about
     ninety members. 
     ‚ÄúA Society for th  relief of poor natives is also in
     operation here. About forty sick are usually entertained at
     a time till t ey get well; and, in all, about 150 rupees
     a month, expended on th  indigent natives. On Wednesday,
     t   16th October, 141 natives, including 16 native
     Christians, were confirmed; and, on th  following Sunday,
     110 communicants attended at t   Lord‚Äôs Table. 
     ‚ÄúAt this station, th  services of a second Chaplain are
     greatly required. Besides one of H. M. regiments, two
     companies of Artillery, and the European details of a
     regiment of Cavalry, and of four regiments of Native
     Infantry, with t  ir schools and hospitals, are to b 
     attended to. In addition to which, the Christians connected
     with t   Residency, and some engaged in mercantile pursuits
     on th  one hand, and Bolaram with its 180 Christians, all
     Protestants, except one family, on th  ot er hand, should
     be visited on alternate Sundays. 
     ‚ÄúJaulna, also within this district, is a large station, and
     should have a Chaplain appointed to it as soon as possible. 
     ‚ÄúAt Masulipatam I remained from Oct. 26 till Nov. 8th.
     Here, as at Bellary, t ere has been no resident Chaplain
     for several years. T e school in th  Pettah, founded by Dr.
     Roy, is at a stand; and no means of education are supplied
     in t   Fort, but by a very aged and nearly superannuated      pensioned sergeant. Prayers are read, and a sermon once on
     Sundays, in t   Fort Church by the Fort adjutant, and in
     th  Pettah chapel by a Civil servant. 
     ‚ÄúThe most urgent desire was expressed here, as at Bellary,
     by t   principal residents, for a resident Chaplain. 
     ‚ÄúOn Friday, 4th of November, forty young persons were
     confirmed, and on t   6th, upwards of forty attended the
     Sacrament. A Chaplain is much needed here, not only on
     account of the number of Protestants at the Station, but
     also on account of the several out-stations in this, and
     neighbouring districts. 
     ‚ÄúPassed Sunday, t   13th of November, at Nellore. About
     sixty persons attended Divine Service in t   Court House,
     of whom fourteen remained to receive t e Sacrament.
     Returned to Madras on November 15th. 
     ‚ÄúThe number of persons confirmed by me at the different
     stations, amounts to 430; and since my return to Madras,
     I have confirmed in t   Cathedral 139,[184] and at t e
     Poonamalee 48, almost all of the newly-arrived recruits,      making a total of 617; of whom not above twenty wer  native
     Christians. T e remainder Europeans, or descendants of
     Europeans. 
     ‚ÄúArchdeacon Harper render d me the most efficient
     assistance during my visitation, in inspecting t e
     Registers, and enquiring into th  state of the Churches
     and burial-grounds at the different Stations, as well a 
     inspecting schools, and visiting t e sick in hospital. At
     Bellary and Masulipatam, t   labours of t   Archdeacon were
     very heavy in examining t e candidates for Confirmation,
     and baptizing many children, and attending several      marriages. Without his aid, my Visitation, imperfect a 
     t is my first essay may have been, would have been far more
     defective. 
     ‚ÄúI have to acknowledge the most ready and obliging
     attentions of all t   Authorities, bot  civil and military,
     with whom my duties brought me into connection. 
     ‚ÄúIn general, I found at each station a considerable
     prevalence of tru  religious feeling and practice,
     especially among th  soldiers of His Majesty‚Äôs regiments,
     and t   Artillery. Temperance Societies are found to b 
     greatly aiding towards the moral improvement of the army;
     and t ough from human infirmity t   pledge is too often
     broken, yet many examples of improvement of character, and
     benefit to health, appear connected with t  se Societies,
     and t   general good of society is forwarded by them. 
     ‚ÄúA fart er proof of the prevalence of Christian principles,
     is the existence of associations for t e relief of the
     native poor, connected with t   several stations. I should
     have noticed in its proper place an association of this
     kind at Masulipatam also. I have known considerable sums
     contributed at different stations, for t e relief of native
     poor on particular emergencies; but this permanent care
     for the native poor, is a manifest improvement in European
     society. 
     ‚ÄúThese associations have in every case I am acquainted
     with, arisen under t e care of a Clergyman, and supply
     evidence of the benefit that might arise to th  country
     generally, were t   Ecclesiastical Establishment properly
     kept up. 
     ‚ÄúThe deficiency in the number of Chaplains is greatly
     felt, and deeply to b  lamented. Not only are several      large stations without the means of grace, but smaller
     stations are left without occasional visits of Chaplains,
     and whole provinces without any appearance of regard by the
     Government for t eir spiritual and eternal good. I would
     earnestly request[185] the attention of the Honourable
     Court of Directors to this most important subject. 
     ‚ÄúSixteen Chaplains only are at their posts, and two are
     sick (t   Reverend Messrs. Cubitt and Gr√¶me.) Besides
     th  stations now supplied, and those I have enumerated
     as calling for Chaplains, formerly t ere was a Chaplain
     at each of the following stations, Poonamatee, Chittoor,
     Vellore, Tellicherry, and Palamcottah. T e circumstances of
     most of these stations are somewhat altered; but connected
     with each of them are ot er stations, which wer  visited
     occasionally by the Chaplains, nearly all of which ar  now
     without the ordinances of religion.‚Äù 
Besides the information which t  se notices convey respecting t e
Bishop‚Äôs proceedings on his Visitation, many additional particulars
of a more private nature are contained in his correspondence with his
wife and relatives. In several of his letters, he complains of having
had to undergo excessive fatigue, and from Secunderabad writes to
Mrs. Corrie:-- 
     ‚ÄúI am desir d by Dr. Meikle to ‚Äòkeep quiet‚Äô for a day or
     two. H  says, I have been over-exerting myself, whilst my
     feeling is that I do nothing to purpose. May God glorify
     Himself in His very poor servant!‚Äù 
The fact was, that in travelling by _dawk_ from the banks of t  
Kistoor to Hyderabad, the journey was performed chiefly in the night,
and t   Bishop‚Äôs rest was consequently disturbed at almost every
stage, by natives of rank, who came to pay t eir respects to him. When entreated by the Archdeacon to spare himself, by declining t ese
civilities, t   Bishop‚Äôs usual reply was, ‚ÄúWhen t  se good people
put themselves to so much inconvenience on my account, how can I
do less than get out of my palankeen, and exchange a kind word with
them?‚Äù In a letter, however, which t   Bishop on his return to Madra 
wrote to Mr. S erer, he observes, ‚ÄúI must not, if spared, make again
so hurried a journey. Time is doing its work with me.‚Äù Yet very soon
after this, all t ought of his own health was absorbed in his anxiety
respecting t at of his wife, who had become so enfeebled as to render
it necessary that a sea-voyage should b  attempted, as the only human
means likely to save her life. But before arrangements could b  made
for carrying t is object into effect, she became suddenly worse; and
after two or three days of suffering, died on t   21st of December
1836, in t   hope of eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
The Bishop drew up, and printed for private circulation, a short
account of his wife‚Äôs last illness. T ere are contained in that
account, passages of much interest, but which cannot  ere be
transcribed: t   substance of all is contained in a single sentence
of a memorandum, penned by the surviving mourner himself, dated

     ‚ÄúDec. 24, 1836. When t   likelihood of her departure began
     to b  manifest, t e Saviour alone was her only ground of
     hope towards God, and that  ope sustained her in peace,
     though t ere was nothing of triumph.‚Äù 
As regarded his own feelings in connection with this heavy domestic
trial, t   Bishop adds:-- 
     ‚ÄúMy feelings of loneliness are indescribable. All before me
     appears blank; I seem cut off from all earthly good. All      this I feel I deserve at the hand of God. He might justly
     have cast me into th  blackness of darkness for ever.
     Just, t erefore, art thou, O Lord, in this dispensation
     which has laid me so low. Teach me, O Lord, to seek
     spiritual improvement in it, and let it prove to me ‚Äòloving
     correction!‚Äô‚Äù 
With reference to this mournful event, t   Bishop also observes in
t   last letter which he lived to address
 
                           TO HIS BROTHER. 
     ‚ÄúYou cannot understand the change it [his wife‚Äôs death] has
     wrought in every circumstance of my life; and how at every
     turn a sense of loss is forced upon me. Yet you have felt
     an aching void on the death of our own parents and near
     connections, and can judge of the intensity of pain I at
     times experience. I will not dwell longer on t   subject. I
     have everything which Christian faith and hope can supply,
     as to the gain my wife has entered upon, but my own sense
     of loss prevents, as yet, t e consolation I might otherwise
     possess.‚Äù 
The necessary occupations, however, connected with his official
duties, tended, in some measure, to lessen the Bishop‚Äôs keen sense of
his ber avement. Among those duties, not t   least engrossing, was an
Ordination of which he had given notice, previously to Mrs. Corrie‚Äôs
decease. The Ordination took place on Sunday the 8th of January
1837. The candidates who presented themselves for Holy Orders wer 
missionaries about to b  employed by the Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel--three for Deacon‚Äôs Orders and t ree for Priest‚Äôs.
Respecting t ese candidates t   Bishop remarks, in t   letter just
quoted, ‚Äúboth Mr. Tucker and t   Archdeacon were well satisfied with
their attainments, as they have just cause to b  with their piety.‚Äù T   Bishop himself preached the Ordination Sermon, from Ep es. iv. 11, 12; and took occasion t  nce to point out the existence of t  
ministry, as a distinctly-instituted Office in the Church of God
throughout all time; explaining, also, the object and end of that
Office, and t   solemn responsibility attached to it. 
It is stated by one who was present on t   occasion, t at t e Sermon
was ‚Äúmarked by lucid simplicity, pathos, fervour, and power; mingled
with kindly feelings toward other bodies of professing Christians.‚Äù And as the opportunity for witnessing t e admission, at one time,
of so many persons into th  Christian ministry, had never before
occurred in sout ern India, t e Cathedral was crowded throughout all
its usual accommodations. 
During this month, also, the attention of the Bishop was a good
deal occupied with t   subject of a new Church for _St. Thom√®_. In
t   preceding June he had addressed a letter to th  Society for
promoting Christian Knowledge, stating t at

     ‚ÄúAt _St. Thom√®_, the original European settlement in      this place, is an immens  population of all classes;
     Hindoos, Mahommedans, Portuguese Christians, and very
     many East Indians baptised in the Established Church,
     and many connected with t   Vepery congregation, distant
     four or five miles. Bishop Turner, when  ere, supplied
     money to purchase a piece of ground on which to erect a
     place of worship: t   purchase was made and the ground
     lies waste. No further attempt  as been made towards
     providing Christian instruction for those hundreds who ar 
     professedly of our communion.‚Äù 
He undertook, t erefore, to ask t e aid of the Society
above-mentioned, toward building a Church for this
spiritually-destitute population; and was so sanguine of the success
of his application, t at toward the end of January, he visited
_St. Thom√®_, attended by the Archdeacon and the Rev. W. Taylor,
for the purpose of surveying t e ground and examining localities.
He afterwards requested Mr. Taylor to prepare the heading of a
subscription-paper, the first name appended to which th  Bishop
purposed to b  t at of ‚ÄúA Friend,‚Äù with a subscription of 1000
rupees; t at ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù having placed a considerable sum at t  
Bishop‚Äôs disposal. Meanwhile, the Society in England entered most
readily into his views, contributing from their funds all the sum he
stated to b  required: but intelligence of t at liberality was not
destined to gladden  is spirit, for his earthly career was now fast
drawing to a close. 
The Bishop, as has been observed, had complained of great fatigue
and exhaustion, when on  is Visitation; but it appears t at when at
Hyderabad, in October 1836, he had suffered also from a pain in the
head, which came on suddenly, and was so acute as to oblige him to
have recourse to medical advice. From that time this pain never left
him; and the constant and peculiar manner in which it affected him,
was only not much noticed because he attributed it all to t e anxiety
of mind he had gone through, on account of his wife. During several
weeks, however, t   Bishop had been frequently observed to make it a
matter of supplication at family-prayer, that  imself and household
‚Äúmight b  prepared for any sudden or unexpected events which might
await them; and might b , moreover, enabled to b ar all in a holy
temper of mind.‚Äù Nor did his petitions prove to b  uns asonable: for
on Tuesday, January 31st, when on  is way to the Fort, in company
with t   Archdeacon, for the purpose of attending t ere a meeting
of the Committee of the Society for propagating t e Gospel, he was
seized with an unusual giddiness, which prevented him from reading
a paper he had in  and. On reaching t e vestry of the Fort church,
h  suffered very much from pain in the head, and sickness, and was
altogether so ill that the Archdeacon (who scarcely ever afterwards
left him) had him conveyed home, and medical aid sent for. After
leeches had been applied to th  head, t   Bishop seemed to recover a
little from the state of stupor in which he was found to b  on first
reaching his house; but,   cept at intervals, he was only partially
conscious throughout the four remaining days of his life. When,
however, h  seemed to revive somewhat, he manifested great pl asure
at  aving passages of scripture read to him. And even on Saturday
Feb. 4th, (t e day before  e died) when sight and consciousness were
well nigh gone, he yet indicated his cordial assent to different
texts of Scripture which his daughter repeated to him. More
particularly when she read Isaiah xii. ‚ÄúI will say, O Lord, I will
praise t ee,‚Äù &c. he asked her to recite Cowper‚Äôs paraphrase:

    I will praise T ee every day
    Now thine anger‚Äôs turned away;
    Comfortable thoughts arise
    From the bleeding sacrifice.

    Here, in the fair gospel-field,
    Wells of free salvation yield,
    Streams of life, a plenteous store,
    And my soul shall thirst no more.

    Jesus is become at length     My salvation and my strength;
    And his praises shall prolong,
    While I liv , my pl asant song.

    Praise ye, then, his glorious name
    Publish his exalted fame!
    Still is work your praise e ceeds
    E cellent are all his deeds.

    Raise again t   joyful sound
    Let t   nations roll it round!
    Zion shout, for this is He,
    God the Saviour dwells in thee:

and himself repeated ‚ÄúFrom the bleeding sacrifice.‚Äù To t e text
‚ÄúBehold t e Lamb of God;‚Äù &c. he answered ‚ÄúYes;‚Äù and on her adding
‚ÄúHim hath God exalted to b  a Prince and a Saviour;‚Äù th  Bishop
remarked, ‚ÄúA Prince and a Saviour on _all_ occasions.‚Äù At anot er
time when his daughter read, ‚ÄúI am the resurrection and the life;‚Äù
&c. he asked, ‚ÄúBelievest thou this?‚Äù Then when 1 John iii. 2, had
been suggested to him, the dying prelate repeated several times ‚ÄúWe
shall see Him as He is.‚Äù The last Scripture of which he seemed to b 
conscious, was Rev. v. 13. ‚ÄúBlessing, and honour, and glory, &c., b 
unto t e Lamb for ever and ever;‚Äù and in this spirit of praise and
t anksgiving he appears to have passed into eternity, for his last
words were, ‚ÄúFor ever,‚Äù--‚ÄúFor ever.‚Äù And so this servant of Christ
entered into rest on the morning of Sunday, Feb. 5, 1837, in the 59th y ar of his age. 
The _post-mortem_ examination of the body exhibited a solid
_coagulum_ of blood, of the size of a turkey‚Äôs egg, situate on
t e right side of the brain, in its substance. The situation and
appearance of the _coagulum_, when taken in connexion with t  
circumstance that the Bishop always felt the pain in the same
spot, led the medical men to conclude that the disease was of some
standing: that it originated, in fact, in the fatigue and anxiety
connected with his Visitation. 
The remains of Bishop Corrie were interred in the Cathedral
burial-ground, on the evening of t e day of his death. The funeral
procession was led by the scholars of the Madras Grammar School, of
which t   Bishop was Patron, and which had been so much indebted to
his fostering care. Then followed Gericke‚Äôs scholars, and the pupils
of the Vepery School; and these were succeeded by a train of Native
Catechists. After them, and immediately preceding t e coffin, came
the Archdeacon and Clergy. The pall was borne by six gentlemen of
rank; and the Governor of the Presidency followed as Chief Mourner,
supported by the Chief Justice, and the Commander-in-Chief. T e
Bishop was deposited by the side of Mrs. Corrie, and within a few
feet of the spot where, six weeks before, he had stood a widowed
mourner over his wife‚Äôs remains.

On Monday, 6th February, the Governor in Council issued an Order
expressive of his sense of ‚Äúthe respect which t   unaffected piety,
benevolence and exemplary life‚Äù of t e deceased Prelate ‚Äúhad
universally inspired.‚Äù This order appeared in the Government Gazette
on the 7th February;[186] and, on the following day, a public
meeting, at which t   Governor presided, was held in the College
Hall, for the purpose of considering t e most appropriate mode of
expressing t e feelings with which t   late Bishop was regarded by
t e inhabitants of the Presidency. This meeting resolved to set on
foot a subscription, in order to raise funds for erecting a monument
in the Cathedral to t e Bishop‚Äôs memory: and it was furt er agreed
t at any surplus of the funds raised for the monument should be
devoted to the founding of scholarships at the Grammar School, to
be called ‚ÄúCorrie Scholarships.‚Äù[187] The Committee of the Madras
Grammar School now resolved also, that t  ir Institution should in
future be designated ‚ÄúBishop Corrie‚Äôs Grammar School.‚Äù--Funds having
accordingly been raised sufficient for the purposes specified, a
monument was executed by the skill and good taste of Mr. Henry
Weekes, which is now in the Cathedral of Madras.

Nor were the Calcutta friends of the deceased Bishop backward
to testify their regard for his worth. For at a public meeting,
which was held on t   16th March, in the Town Hall, Bishop Wilson
being in t   chair, it was resolved to solicit subscriptions for
t e purpose of erecting marble slabs, bot  in t   old Church and
in the Cathedral, to t e memory of t e deceased Prelate; and for
t e purchase of a Portrait of him. It was, moreover, resolved to
appropriate any surplus funds derived from such subscriptions, to t e
founding of scholarships in the Calcutta High School, to be called
‚ÄúBishop Corrie‚Äôs Scholarships.‚Äù[188] And all these tokens of respect
were in due time effected. 
In Ceylon, also, a general meeting was called at the King‚Äôs house,
Colombo, by His Excellency the Governor, at which, subscriptions were
entered into for the purpose of erecting a monument to t e Bishop‚Äôs
memory in St. Peter‚Äôs Church, Colombo, and for founding scholarships,
which should bear his name, in the Grammar School at Madras. Bot 
which objects were accomplished.[189] 
Thus terminated the eart ly labours of the first Bishop of Madras,
after a brief but not unimportant episcopate, if a judgment may be
formed from the amount of good effected, from the general gloom which
t e Bishop‚Äôs decease cast over the whole Presidency, and the respect
with which his memory was cherished. To t ose who were intimately
acquainted with Bishop Corrie, it will not excite surprise that his
death should have called forth all the public manifestations of
sorrow and respect, which have here been recited. For after making
every abatement for that human sinfulness and infirmity from which   
was not exempt, there still remained to him more than an ordinary
share of natural kindness of heart, benevolence of disposition, and
warmth of affection; so that he could not but be generally beloved. Nor will the reader of t ese pages be disposed to question that
Bishop Corrie will long be remembered in India, as t e man of God,
through w ose instrumentality originated much of the moral good
which, since his time, has been slowly spreading itself over that
land of darkness and superstition.[190] But chiefly, it is believed,
will his name he held in honour throughout our Eastern Empire, as
one of that small band of heroic spirits who, in self-devotion to
Christ and zeal for the extension of the Redeemer‚Äôs kingdom, manfully
struggled against difficulties and discouragements of which we can
form but an inadequate estimate:--who never suffered themselves to
doubt but that t   cause they had by grace espoused would still go
on and prosper, until ‚Äúat the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
and every tongue confess that He is Lord, unto the glory of God the
Father.‚Äù   
      [180] T e meeting was held in the College Hall, at Madras,
            on the 6th of June.

      [181] The following was t e communication here mentioned:
            ‚ÄúThe accompanying [Memorial] was brought to me a
            few days since with a request t at I would join in
            a representation to Government on the subject of
            its contents. I have always abstained from taking
            part in such representations, being aware that
            Government may have good reasons for measures,
            which the public cannot be acquainted with; and, in
            respect of interference with Pagodas, &c., I have
            the fullest confidence that Government will pursue
            the course which appears wise and proper. But with
            reference to the Christian military servants of the
            State, who are occasionally compelled to do honour
            to the superstitions of the country, I am persuaded
            you will not take amiss my bringing t   case to
            your notice. I have marked the statements in the
            printed paper which seem to require relief, with
            the instances cited in the Appendix, assured that
            your own benevolent regard for the feelings of the
            Christian soldiery will bring them all the relief
            that is desirable.‚Äù         [182] A school for country-born children, who received a
            Christian education, and became fifers, &c. to t e
            Company‚Äôs Native troops. T e school was afterwards
            removed to Arcot.

      [183] About 1000 rupees were, in consequence, collected
            toward another building; but it does not appear that
            since t e Bishop‚Äôs time any Church has been erected
            there.  
      [184] T e Confirmation in the Cathedral was held on
            Wednesday, Nov. 30, 1836.

      [185] It is satisfactory to know that t is request has
            been attended to.  

The following notice appeared in the Government Gazette of Feb. 7th,
1837:--   ‚ÄúWith feelings of unfeigned sorrow, the Right Honorable the Governor
in Council, records the demise of the Right Rev. the Lord Bishop of
Madras. T e Venerable Prelate expired at half past three o‚Äôclock, on
the morning of Sunday last. As a tribute of respect to his memory,
the flag of the garrison was hoisted half-staff-high during the day,
and on the funeral procession leaving his Lordship‚Äôs late residence,
fifty-nine minute guns, corresponding with the age of the deceased,
were fired from the Fort battery.

‚ÄúHis Lordship‚Äôs remains were attended to the grave by the Right
Honorable the Governor, the Judges of the Supreme Court, His
Excellency the Commander-in-chief, t e members of Council, all the
principal civil and military functionaries at t   Presidency, and
an immense concourse of all classes of the community; desirous of
manifesting the feeling of respect which the unaffected piety,
benevolence and exemplary conduct of t e Bishop, had universally
inspired.   ‚ÄúPublished by order of the Right Honourable the Governor in Council.
                                ‚Äú(Signed) H. Chamier, Chief Secretary.‚Äù   
                                 II.

On Wednesday evening, Feb. 8th, 1837, a public meeting was held at
t e College, for the purpose of considering the fittest mode of
testifying t   regard and respect entertained for the character of
the late Bishop Corrie.  
The Right Honourable the Governor in the chair. The following
resolutions were proposed and carried unanimously:--        1st. That a subscription be entered into for the purpose
       of erecting a monument in the Cathedral at Madras to t e
       memory of the Right Rev. the late Lord Bishop of the
       Diocese.
         Proposed by Sir F. Adam.
         Seconded by Sir. R. Comyn.

     2nd. That after setting aside a sum sufficient to defray
       the expences of the monument, the residue form a fund
       for the endowment of scholarships, to be called, ‚ÄúBishop
       Corrie‚Äôs scholarships,‚Äù in Bishop Corrie‚Äôs Grammar school.
         Proposed by Sir P. Maitland.
         Seconded by Mr. Sullivan.

     3rd. That a Committee be formed for the purpose of carrying
       the above resolutions into effect, and that it be composed

       undertake t e office of Treasurers.
         Proposed by the Archdeacon.
         Seconded by Captain Dalrymple.

     5th. Thanks to t e Chairman (for his kindness in taking t e
       chair and for his able conduct in it) having been proposed
       by Brigadier General Doveton, and seconded by Colonel
       Waugh, t e meeting was dissolved.   
                                 III.  
     At a public Meeting of the friends of the late Bishop of
       Madras, held at the Town Hall, [Calcutta] on March 16, 1837. It
       was resolved,
      1st. That t is Meeting has heard with the deepest regret of
       the demise of the Bishop of Madras, and consider it a duty
       which they owe to t e Church of which he was so distinguished a
       member, to raise some token of regard to his character at t is
       Presidency, which was the scene of his arduous labours, and his
       preeminent example for almost thirty years.

     2nd. That Subscriptions be solicited for the purpose of
       erecting a Marble Slab in the Old Church, near those of his
       revered friends Brown, Martyn and Thomason, and a similar one in
       the Cathedral; and for painting a likeness of the late Bishop,
       to be hung up in the Old Church Rooms.

     3rd. That the surplus which may remain after defraying t e
       expenses of the Monuments and the Portrait, be appropriated
       for the purpose of endowing Scholarships in the Calcutta High        School, to be called ‚ÄúBishop Corrie‚Äôs Scholarships,‚Äù and
       that especial regard be had in the nomination, to eventual
       preparation for Missionary labour.        4th. That a Committee be formed of the following Gentlemen,
       to see these objects carried into effect, viz. to nominate t e
       Trustees for the above purposes.

             A. Beattie, Esq.
             C. W. Brietzcke, Esq.
             Rev. R. B. Boswell, Secretary.

     5th. That Messrs. Gisborne and Co. be appointed Treasurers,        and those who are friendly to the above design, be requested
       to forward their Subscriptions to t ose Gentlemen as early as
       possible.


Resolution of Committee on 6th April, 1837. 
The Committee, understanding that an excellent likeness of the late
Bishop is in the possession of his friends in England,

Resolved that the Secretary be authorised to write to t e Rev. George
Corrie, of Catharine Hall, Cambridge, and request him to obtain a
copy of this likeness, executed in the best possible way, and to have
t e same suitably framed and transmitted to India with as little
delay as possible.

                                  V.  
The preceding pages bear sufficient testimony to the zeal and
activity of Bishop Corrie, in forwarding every plan for securing
a Christian education to the youth of India. But it is well
known among the deceased Prelate‚Äôs friends, that he was in the
habit of translating and compiling school-books for the use of
such Hindoostanee schools as more immediately came under his own
superintendance. It is a matter of regret that the many enquiries
which the Editors of these Memoirs have made, with a view to
obtaining a definite list of the books in question, have been but
partially successful. It may, however, be mentioned that besides
translating into Hindoostanee, Sellon‚Äôs Abridgment of Scripture, Watts‚Äô Catechism, The Assembly‚Äôs Shorter Catechism, portions of
Milner‚Äôs Church History, &c., the Bishop drew up in English, ‚ÄúA
general Outline of Ancient History,‚Äù for the use of the Hindoostanee
youth. A third Edition of t is ‚ÄúOutline‚Äù was going through the press
at t e time of the Bishop‚Äôs death; and other Editions have since
t en been printed. Among his papers was found, also, a manuscript
translation into Hindoostanee of a brief Church History, by t e Rev. E. Sims, entitled ‚ÄúChristian Records.‚Äù

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
t at you will support t e Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢
works in compliance with t e terms of t is agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ name associated with t e work. You can easily

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢

Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ is synonymous with t e free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by t e widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of t e efforts    hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with t e
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢‚Äôs
goals and ensuring that t e Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, t e Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing t e number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by t e widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with t e IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with t e laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of t e United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with t ese requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine t e status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met t e solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside t e United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was t e originator of t e Project
Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
t e U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has t e main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg‚Ñ¢,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
